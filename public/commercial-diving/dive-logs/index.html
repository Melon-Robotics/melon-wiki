IMCA guidelines recommend retaining dive records for at least 5 years. ADCI Consensus Standards require 5 years for routine operational logs. Records relating to personal injury, decompression sickness treatment, or incident investigation should be retained indefinitely — claims can arise years after an incident.

This page covers what must be recorded, how records must be maintained, and why this matters for regulatory compliance, incident investigation, and legal defense.\nWhy This Exists Operational records serve multiple critical purposes:\nRegulatory compliance — Required by IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, and national regulations Incident investigation — Essential for reconstructing what happened and why Insurance claims — Required documentation for commercial diving insurance coverage Legal defense — Proper records protect operators, supervisors, and divers in disputes Operational improvement — Historical data informs future planning and risk assessment What can go wrong: Incomplete records, lost records, altered records, untraceable records. Each failure mode creates regulatory, legal, and operational risk — including criminal liability for supervisors in some jurisdictions.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors maintaining operational records Safety officers auditing record-keeping compliance Regulators reviewing diving operations Incident investigators reconstructing dive events Insurance underwriters assessing operational risk Legal counsel defending diving operations Printable Dive Log Template Use this template for a single dive entry.

Incident records: retain indefinitely.\nReference: IMCA M 103, ADCI Consensus Standards, USN Diving Manual Rev 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010)\nRequired Records Dive Log Entries Each dive must be logged with:\nDate and time — Start time, bottom time, surface time, completion time Location — Geographic coordinates (GPS), water depth at dive site, structure or work site ID Diver information — Diver name, certification level, certification number, medical clearance expiry Depth profile — Maximum depth (FSW), time at depth, descent and ascent rates Gas information — Gas mix specified and analyzed, O2%, He%, CO analysis date, cylinder pressures Decompression — Table and schedule used, stops completed with depths and times, deviations if any Work performed — Tasks completed, equipment used, findings, issues encountered Environmental conditions — Current speed and direction, visibility, sea state, water temperature Team composition — Supervisor name, standby diver name, tender name, DMO contact Equipment — Primary and backup equipment used, pre-dive inspection results, equipment issues Traceability: Each entry must be timestamped and attributable to a specific person. Records must be immutable once created — corrections require amendment notes, not erasures.\nEquipment Records Equipment must be tracked:\nInspection records — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance, out-of-service events Calibration records — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment, O2 analyzers Maintenance records — Repairs, replacements, modifications with part numbers and dates Failure records — Equipment failures, near-misses, corrective actions taken Audit-worthiness: Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.\nTraining Records Personnel qualifications must be documented:\nCertifications — Diver certifications (ADCI, IMCA, HSE, or equivalent), supervisor qualifications, medical fitness certificates Training history — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training, emergency drills Dive history — Cumulative dive hours, types of operations, specific qualifications (bell diving, saturation, etc.) Incident Reports Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:\nIncident description — What happened, when, where, who was involved Causal analysis — Why it happened, contributing factors, root cause Response actions — What was done in response, immediate and follow-up Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Legal sensitivity: Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate. Do not speculate or assign blame — describe what happened and what was done.\nRecord-Keeping Requirements Timeliness Records must be created:\nDuring operations — Real-time logging of depth, time, and gas data Immediately after — Post-dive debrief, decompression completion, supervisor countersignature Within 24 hours — Final log review, incident notification if required What can go wrong: Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly — records must be contemporaneous to be credible in investigation or litigation.\nAccuracy Records must use measured values, not estimates:\nDepth — From calibrated depth gauge, not estimated Time — From synchronized timepieces, not reconstructed Gas — Analyzed O2%, not assumed from cylinder label Pressure — From calibrated gauges, with before/after readings Completeness All required fields completed — no blank mandatory fields All dives logged — no skipped entries regardless of dive duration All decompression stops recorded with actual times, not planned times Immutability Records must be immutable once signed:\nNo overwriting — Errors corrected with a single line strike-through, initialed and dated Amendment process — Significant corrections require a separate amendment note with reason, date, and signature No backdating — All entries dated and timed at creation Data Provenance Records must demonstrate data provenance:\nSource — Where did the data originate? Instrument? Observation? Calculation? Method — Direct measurement, estimation, or derived value? Chain of custody — Who recorded the data, who verified it, how was it transferred? Audit-worthiness: Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors. Records that cannot be traced to a source are not credible.\nStorage \u0026 Retention Storage Requirements Secure storage — Protected from loss, damage, fire, water, and unauthorized access Backup — Redundant copies in separate physical locations or cloud storage with access controls Access control — Only authorized personnel can view or modify records Format — Readable format that will remain accessible for the full retention period Retention Periods Record Type Minimum Retention Basis Dive logs (routine) 5 years IMCA M 103, ADCI Equipment inspection records 5 years or equipment life Manufacturer / regulator Training \u0026 certification records Duration of employment + 5 years Standard practice Incident reports Indefinite Statute of limitations Personal injury records Indefinite Legal requirement Gas analysis records 5 years Standard practice Operational reality: Many jurisdictions and contracts require retention beyond these minimums. When in doubt, retain longer.\nDigital vs. Paper Records Digital records — Advantages: searchable, easily backed up, can support audit trails, integrates with decompression software. Challenges: format obsolescence, system dependencies, cybersecurity requirements, integrity verification.\nPaper records — Advantages: universally readable, legally established, no technology dependency. Challenges: physical storage, difficult to search at scale, backup requires physical copying.\nBest practice: Dual records (digital primary, paper backup for critical dives) provide the advantages of both. The paper record must be a faithful copy of the digital record, not a summary.\nAudit Requirements Records must support the following audit types:\nRegulatory audits — IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, flag state, coastal state Client audits — Third-party verification of contract compliance Insurance audits — Risk assessment and claims verification Internal audits — Quality assurance and continuous improvement What auditors look for: Complete entries, supervisor signatures, calibration records, training records cross-referenced to personnel, gas analysis certificates, incident report trails. Gaps in any of these create audit findings.\nFrequently Asked Questions What must be in a commercial diving log? Every commercial dive log entry must include: date and times (start, max depth, surfaced), GPS location, diver identity and certification, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2%, decompression schedule followed and any deviations, work performed, environmental conditions, and supervisor signature. See the printable template above for a complete field reference.\nHow long must records be kept? Minimum 5 years for routine logs (IMCA/ADCI). Indefinite for incident reports and records involving personal injury. Many operators keep all records for 7-10 years. Check your contract, your jurisdiction, and your insurer’s requirements — they may be more stringent.\nWhat makes a record legally defensible? Contemporaneous creation (not reconstructed from memory), measured values from calibrated instruments, complete required fields, supervisor countersignature, immutable storage with audit trail. Records that can be shown to have been altered, backdated, or estimated rather than measured are not credible in legal proceedings.\nRelated Topics USN Dive Tables — Decompression table reference Dive Planning \u0026 Risk Assessment Ocean Data \u0026 Trust — Data provenance and integrity principles Safety, Risk \u0026 Compliance — Regulatory requirements ","wordCount":"1550","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Melon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wiki.melon.org/commercial-diving/dive-logs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Melon Wiki","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wiki.melon.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/custom.min.css></head><body id=top><header class=site-header><nav><button class=menu-toggle id=menu-toggle aria-label="Toggle menu">

Challenges: format obsolescence, system dependencies, cybersecurity requirements, integrity verification.</p><p><strong>Paper records</strong> — Advantages: universally readable, legally established, no technology dependency. Challenges: physical storage, difficult to search at scale, backup requires physical copying.</p><p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Dual records (digital primary, paper backup for critical dives) provide the advantages of both. The paper record must be a faithful copy of the digital record, not a summary.</p><hr><h2 id=audit-requirements>Audit Requirements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#audit-requirements>#</a></h2><p>Records must support the following audit types:</p><ul><li><strong>Regulatory audits</strong> — IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, flag state, coastal state</li><li><strong>Client audits</strong> — Third-party verification of contract compliance</li><li><strong>Insurance audits</strong> — Risk assessment and claims verification</li><li><strong>Internal audits</strong> — Quality assurance and continuous improvement</li></ul><p><strong>What auditors look for:</strong> Complete entries, supervisor signatures, calibration records, training records cross-referenced to personnel, gas analysis certificates, incident report trails. Gaps in any of these create audit findings.</p><hr><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#frequently-asked-questions>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-must-be-in-a-commercial-diving-log>What must be in a commercial diving log?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-must-be-in-a-commercial-diving-log>#</a></h3><p>Every commercial dive log entry must include: date and times (start, max depth, surfaced), GPS location, diver identity and certification, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2%, decompression schedule followed and any deviations, work performed, environmental conditions, and supervisor signature. See the printable template above for a complete field reference.</p><h3 id=how-long-must-records-be-kept>How long must records be kept?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-long-must-records-be-kept>#</a></h3><p>Minimum 5 years for routine logs (IMCA/ADCI). Indefinite for incident reports and records involving personal injury. Many operators keep all records for 7-10 years. Check your contract, your jurisdiction, and your insurer&rsquo;s requirements — they may be more stringent.</p><h3 id=what-makes-a-record-legally-defensible>What makes a record legally defensible?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-makes-a-record-legally-defensible>#</a></h3><p>Contemporaneous creation (not reconstructed from memory), measured values from calibrated instruments, complete required fields, supervisor countersignature, immutable storage with audit trail. Records that can be shown to have been altered, backdated, or estimated rather than measured are not credible in legal proceedings.</p><hr><h2 id=related-topics>Related Topics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#related-topics>#</a></h2><ul><li><a href=/commercial-diving/usn-dive-tables/>USN Dive Tables</a> — Decompression table reference</li><li><a href=/commercial-diving/dive-planning/>Dive Planning & Risk Assessment</a></li><li><a href=/ocean-data/>Ocean Data & Trust</a> — Data provenance and integrity principles</li><li><a href=/safety-compliance/>Safety, Risk & Compliance</a> — Regulatory requirements</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></div></div></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://wiki.melon.org/>Melon Wiki</a></span> ·
