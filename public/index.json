[{"content":"ALARP Principles ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable. This page covers what ALARP means in practice and how to implement it for ocean operations.\nWhy This Exists ALARP is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and a best practice in others. It provides a framework for making risk decisions that balances risk reduction with practical constraints. Understanding ALARP is essential for regulatory compliance and defensible risk management.\nWho This Is For Safety officers implementing risk management Operations managers making risk decisions Regulators reviewing risk assessments Auditors verifying ALARP compliance Legal counsel defending risk decisions ALARP Definition ALARP means reducing risk to the lowest level that is:\nTechnically feasible — Can it be done with available technology? Economically reasonable — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operationally practical — Can it be implemented in practice? Key point: ALARP is not zero risk. It is the lowest risk that is reasonably practicable given constraints.\nALARP Assessment Process Step 1: Identify All Reasonably Practicable Controls For each identified risk, identify all controls that could reasonably be implemented:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or systems reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is available? What can go wrong: Controls not identified, controls dismissed without assessment, impractical controls included. Assessment must be thorough and realistic.\nStep 2: Assess Cost vs. Risk Reduction For each control, assess:\nRisk reduction — How much does this control reduce risk? (quantified where possible) Implementation cost — What does it cost to implement? (capital, operational, maintenance) Cost-effectiveness — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operational reality: Cost includes not just money, but also operational complexity, maintenance burden, and other practical constraints.\nStep 3: Implement Controls Where Justified Implement controls where:\nRisk reduction is significant — Control meaningfully reduces risk Cost is reasonable — Cost is justified by risk reduction Implementation is practical — Control can be implemented in practice What can go wrong: Controls not implemented despite justification, controls implemented without justification, implementation incomplete. Decisions must be documented.\nStep 4: Document Decisions For each control decision, document:\nControl description — What control was considered? Risk reduction — How much risk reduction would it provide? Implementation cost — What would it cost to implement? Decision — Implement or not implement, and why Decision authority — Who made the decision? Legal requirement: ALARP decisions must be documented and defensible. Undocumented decisions create legal and regulatory risk.\nALARP Zones Intolerable Risk Risk that is unacceptable regardless of cost:\nMust be reduced — Risk must be reduced below intolerable level No cost-benefit analysis — Cost is not a factor; risk must be reduced Regulatory intervention — Regulators may prohibit operations if risk is intolerable Operational reality: Intolerable risk is rare but serious. Operations with intolerable risk should not proceed.\nALARP Zone Risk that is tolerable but should be reduced:\nMust demonstrate ALARP — Must show that risk is ALARP Cost-benefit analysis — Cost vs. risk reduction must be assessed Documentation required — Decisions must be documented Most operations fall here: Most operational risks are in the ALARP zone, requiring assessment and documentation.\nBroadly Acceptable Risk Risk that is so low that further reduction is not required:\nNo further action — No need to reduce risk further No documentation required — May not require detailed documentation Rare in practice — Most operational risks are not broadly acceptable Operational reality: Broadly acceptable risk is rare in commercial diving and subsea operations.\nPractical Implementation Risk Assessment Start with thorough risk assessment:\nIdentify hazards — All significant hazards must be identified Assess risk — Quantify risk where possible, qualitatively where not Compare to criteria — Compare risk to intolerable and broadly acceptable criteria What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, risk underestimated, criteria not applied correctly. Risk assessment must be thorough.\nControl Identification Identify all reasonably practicable controls:\nBrainstorm controls — Consider all possible controls Assess feasibility — Determine which controls are technically feasible Assess practicality — Determine which controls are operationally practical Operational reality: Control identification requires experience and creativity. External expertise may be needed.\nCost-Benefit Analysis Assess cost vs. risk reduction:\nQuantify risk reduction — How much does control reduce risk? (where possible) Quantify cost — What does control cost? (capital, operational, maintenance) Compare — Is cost justified by risk reduction? What can go wrong: Risk reduction overestimated, cost underestimated, comparison not done. Analysis must be realistic and documented.\nDecision Making Make and document decisions:\nDecision authority — Who has authority to make ALARP decisions? Decision process — What process is used to make decisions? Documentation — How are decisions documented? Responsibility: Management typically has decision authority. Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nCommon Pitfalls \u0026ldquo;We Can\u0026rsquo;t Afford It\u0026rdquo; Cost alone is not sufficient reason to not implement a control:\nMust assess — Cost must be assessed against risk reduction Must justify — Decision not to implement must be justified Must document — Justification must be documented What can go wrong: Controls dismissed based on cost without assessment, decisions not documented. Cost is a factor, but not the only factor.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Too Complex\u0026rdquo; Complexity alone is not sufficient reason:\nMust assess — Complexity must be assessed against risk reduction Must consider alternatives — Simpler alternatives may exist Must document — Decision must be documented Operational reality: Complexity is a valid constraint, but must be assessed, not assumed.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve Always Done It This Way\u0026rdquo; Tradition is not justification:\nMust assess — Existing practices must be assessed against ALARP Must improve — If better practices exist, they should be considered Must document — Decision to continue existing practice must be documented What can go wrong: Existing practices not assessed, better practices not considered, status quo assumed acceptable. ALARP requires continuous improvement.\nRegulatory Considerations Legal Requirements ALARP may be a legal requirement:\nUK regulations — ALARP is a legal requirement under UK health and safety law Other jurisdictions — Similar requirements may exist in other jurisdictions Industry standards — IMCA, DNV, and other standards may require ALARP Responsibility: Operators must comply with legal requirements. Non-compliance creates legal risk.\nRegulatory Review Regulators may review ALARP assessments:\nDocumentation review — Regulators may review ALARP documentation Decision challenge — Regulators may challenge ALARP decisions Enforcement — Non-compliance may result in enforcement action Audit-worthiness: ALARP documentation must be suitable for regulatory review. Inadequate documentation creates regulatory risk.\nRelated Topics Operational Risk Models Hazard Identification (HAZID/HAZOP) Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment ","permalink":"/safety-compliance/alarp/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"alarp-principles\"\u003eALARP Principles\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable.

This page covers acoustic, RF, and hybrid communication systems, their capabilities, limitations, and failure modes.\nWhy This Exists Communication enables coordination, control, and data transfer in subsea operations. Understanding communication options, tradeoffs, and failure modes is essential for designing and operating multi-vehicle systems.\nWho This Is For Robotics engineers designing communication systems Operations managers planning multi-vehicle operations ROV pilots operating in communication-limited environments System architects designing networked systems Communication Options Acoustic Communication Acoustic modems use sound waves to transmit data through water:\nRange — Typically 1-10km depending on frequency and power Bandwidth — Low bandwidth (typically \u0026lt;10 kbps) Latency — High latency (speed of sound in water ~1500 m/s) Reliability — Affected by noise, multipath, and environmental conditions Operational reality: Acoustic communication is the standard for long-range subsea communication, but it is slow and unreliable.\nWhat can go wrong: Communication loss due to range, noise, multipath, equipment failure. Acoustic communication is inherently unreliable.\nRF Communication Radio frequency communication through water:\nRange — Very limited (typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater) Bandwidth — Higher bandwidth than acoustic (typically 100+ kbps) Latency — Low latency (speed of light) Reliability — Good reliability at short range Operational reality: RF is only practical at very short range. Seawater is highly conductive, severely limiting RF range.\nWhat can go wrong: Range exceeded, interference, equipment failure. RF is not practical for most subsea operations.\nHybrid Systems Combining acoustic and RF:\nAcoustic for long-range — Use acoustic for vehicle-to-surface or vehicle-to-vehicle at range RF for short-range — Use RF for high-bandwidth at short range Automatic switching — Switch between systems based on range and requirements Operational reality: Hybrid systems provide best of both worlds, but add complexity.\nWhat can go wrong: Switching failures, system complexity, increased failure modes. Hybrid systems must be carefully designed.\nTether (ROV) Hard-wired connection for ROVs:\nRange — Limited by tether length (typically \u0026lt;1000m) Bandwidth — Very high bandwidth (fiber optic) Latency — Very low latency Reliability — High reliability if tether intact Operational reality: Tether provides best communication but limits vehicle mobility and range.\nWhat can go wrong: Tether damage, tether length limitations, entanglement. Tether is not practical for all operations.\nCommunication Characteristics Latency Communication latency affects:\nReal-time control — High latency makes real-time control difficult Coordination — High latency affects coordination capability Data freshness — High latency means data is stale when received Operational reality: Acoustic latency (speed of sound) is ~0.67 seconds per kilometer. At 5km range, round-trip latency is ~6.7 seconds. This is too slow for real-time control.\nBandwidth Communication bandwidth affects:\nData transfer — How much data can be transferred Video feeds — High-bandwidth required for video Sensor data — Bandwidth limits sensor data transfer Operational reality: Acoustic bandwidth is typically \u0026lt;10 kbps, insufficient for video. RF provides higher bandwidth but limited range.\nReliability Communication reliability affects:\nMission success — Unreliable communication may cause mission failure Safety — Unreliable communication creates safety risk Coordination — Unreliable communication makes coordination difficult What can go wrong: Communication loss, intermittent communication, degraded communication. Systems must be designed for unreliable communication.\nFailure Modes Range Exceeded Communication lost because range exceeded:\nAcoustic — Range typically 1-10km depending on conditions RF — Range typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater Tether — Range limited by tether length Response: Vehicle must operate autonomously when communication lost. See Loss-of-Comms Behavior.\nEnvironmental Interference Communication degraded by environmental conditions:\nAcoustic noise — Ship noise, biological noise, other acoustic sources Multipath — Acoustic signals reflected off surfaces Attenuation — Signal strength reduced by distance and conditions What can go wrong: Communication degraded or lost due to environmental conditions. Systems must be robust to environmental interference.\nEquipment Failure Communication equipment fails:\nModem failure — Acoustic or RF modem fails Antenna failure — Antenna damaged or disconnected Power failure — Communication equipment loses power Response: Backup communication systems, or vehicle operates autonomously. See Graceful Degradation.\nCommunication Protocols Message-Based Protocols Send discrete messages:\nAdvantages — Simple, robust to loss, works with low bandwidth Disadvantages — No continuous data streams, higher overhead Operational reality: Message-based protocols are common for acoustic communication due to low bandwidth and high latency.\nStream-Based Protocols Continuous data streams:\nAdvantages — Efficient for continuous data, lower overhead Disadvantages — Requires reliable connection, not suitable for low bandwidth Operational reality: Stream-based protocols are used for tethered systems with high bandwidth and low latency.\nHybrid Protocols Combine message-based and stream-based:\nMessages for control — Use messages for commands and status Streams for data — Use streams for high-bandwidth data when available Operational reality: Hybrid protocols provide flexibility but add complexity.\nOperational Considerations Communication Planning Plan communication for operations:\nRange requirements — What range is needed? Bandwidth requirements — What bandwidth is needed? Latency requirements — What latency is acceptable? Reliability requirements — What reliability is needed? What can go wrong: Communication not planned, requirements not met, backup not available. Communication planning is essential.\nBackup Communication Provide backup communication:\nMultiple systems — Acoustic and RF, or multiple acoustic systems Redundant equipment — Backup modems and antennas Alternative methods — Surface-to-surface coordination, visual signals Operational reality: Backup communication is essential. Single point of failure is unacceptable.\nAutonomous Operation Vehicles must operate autonomously:\nWhen communication lost — Vehicle continues mission autonomously When communication degraded — Vehicle adapts to available communication Pre-programmed behavior — Vehicle follows pre-programmed procedures Responsibility: Vehicle designers must ensure autonomous capability. Operators must understand autonomous behavior.\nRelated Topics Multi-Vehicle Coordination Latency \u0026amp; Bandwidth Tradeoffs Graceful Degradation Loss-of-Comms Behavior ","permalink":"/swarm-systems/communications/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"communication-systems\"\u003eCommunication Systems\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsea communication is fundamentally different from terrestrial communication.

Chain-of-custody tracks data as it moves through systems and organizations. This page covers why this matters for ocean operations and how to implement it in practice.\nWhy This Exists Data provenance enables:\nAudit verification — Auditors can verify data accuracy by tracing to source Incident investigation — Investigators can reconstruct what happened from data records Regulatory compliance — Regulators require traceable data for compliance verification Legal defense — Provenance protects operators in disputes by demonstrating data integrity Operational trust — Operators can trust data when they know its source and handling What can go wrong: Data without provenance cannot be verified, data with broken chain-of-custody is not credible, missing provenance creates legal and operational risk.\nWho This Is For Data engineers designing data systems Operations personnel recording operational data Auditors verifying data accuracy Incident investigators reconstructing events Legal counsel defending operations Regulators reviewing compliance Provenance Requirements Source Identification Every data record must identify:\nSource system — What system created the data? (sensor, instrument, calculation, human entry) Source location — Where was the data created? (vehicle, surface system, geographic location) Creation method — How was the data created? (direct measurement, calculation, estimation, observation) Creation time — When was the data created? (timestamp with timezone and synchronization method) Operational reality: Source identification must be automatic where possible. Manual entry is error-prone and should be minimized.\nTransformation Tracking When data is transformed, track:\nTransformation type — What transformation was applied? (filtering, calibration, unit conversion, calculation) Transformation parameters — What parameters were used? (calibration coefficients, filter settings, algorithm version) Transformation time — When was the transformation applied? Transformation system — What system performed the transformation? What can go wrong: Transformations not documented, transformation parameters lost, transformations applied incorrectly. Each transformation must be traceable.\nChain-of-Custody As data moves through systems, track:\nTransfer events — When data was transferred, from where to where Transfer method — How data was transferred (network, storage media, manual) Transfer integrity — How integrity was verified (checksums, signatures) Custodian — Who or what system had custody at each point Legal requirement: Chain-of-custody must be unbroken. Gaps in chain-of-custody reduce data credibility in legal proceedings.\nImplementation Approaches Metadata Embedding Embed provenance in data records:\nStructured metadata — JSON, XML, or structured fields in data records Header information — Provenance in file headers or message headers Database fields — Provenance columns in database tables Advantages: Provenance travels with data, no separate tracking system required.\nChallenges: Metadata can be lost or altered, requires discipline to maintain.\nSeparate Provenance Logs Maintain separate logs tracking data:\nEvent logs — Log each data creation, transformation, and transfer event Data registry — Registry mapping data identifiers to provenance records Audit trails — Immutable audit trails of all data operations Advantages: Centralized tracking, easier to audit, can be made tamper-resistant.\nChallenges: Requires infrastructure, must be kept synchronized with data.\nHybrid Approaches Combine embedding and logging:\nEmbedded metadata — Lightweight provenance in data records Centralized logs — Detailed provenance in centralized systems Cross-references — Data records reference centralized logs Operational reality: Hybrid approaches balance convenience and auditability. Most practical systems use hybrid approaches.\nProvenance for Different Data Types Sensor Data Sensor data provenance must include:\nSensor identification — Sensor type, serial number, calibration status Measurement conditions — Environmental conditions, sensor configuration Calibration information — Calibration date, coefficients, traceability Data acquisition — Sampling rate, filtering, timestamp synchronization What can go wrong: Sensor misidentified, calibration not recorded, conditions not documented. Sensor data without provenance is not credible.\nCalculated Data Calculated data provenance must include:\nInput data — What data was used as input? (with provenance) Calculation method — What algorithm or formula was used? Calculation parameters — What parameters were used? Calculation system — What system performed the calculation? (software version, configuration) What can go wrong: Input data not identified, calculation method not documented, parameters lost. Calculated data must be reproducible.\nHuman-Entered Data Human-entered data provenance must include:\nEntered by — Who entered the data? Entry time — When was it entered? Entry method — How was it entered? (form, log, voice transcription) Source information — What was the source of the information? (observation, measurement, communication) What can go wrong: Entered by not recorded, entry time inaccurate, source not documented. Human-entered data requires careful provenance tracking.\nChain-of-Custody Procedures Data Transfer When transferring data:\nVerify source — Confirm data source and provenance Transfer securely — Use secure transfer methods with integrity verification Record transfer — Log transfer event with timestamp and parties Verify receipt — Confirm data received and integrity verified Update custody — Update chain-of-custody records Responsibility: Both sender and receiver must verify and record transfer.\nData Storage When storing data:\nSecure storage — Protect from unauthorized access and modification Access logging — Log all access to stored data Integrity verification — Regularly verify data integrity (checksums, signatures) Backup procedures — Backup data with provenance intact What can go wrong: Unauthorized access, data modification, integrity loss, backup without provenance. Storage systems must protect data and provenance.\nData Access When accessing data:\nAccess logging — Log who accessed what data when Purpose documentation — Document why data was accessed Integrity verification — Verify data integrity before use Provenance review — Review provenance before relying on data Audit requirement: Access logs must be maintained for audit. Unauthorized or undocumented access creates risk.\nVerification \u0026amp; Validation Provenance Verification Verify provenance:\nSource verification — Can source be verified? Is source credible? Chain verification — Is chain-of-custody unbroken? Transformation verification — Can transformations be verified? Are they correct? Timeline verification — Do timestamps make sense? Are they consistent? What can go wrong: Provenance cannot be verified, chain-of-custody broken, transformations incorrect, timestamps inconsistent. Unverifiable provenance reduces data credibility.\nData Validation Validate data against provenance:\nSource validation — Does data match expected source characteristics? Range validation — Is data within expected ranges for source? Consistency validation — Is data consistent with other data from same source? Temporal validation — Does data make sense temporally? Operational reality: Validation catches errors early. Invalid data should trigger investigation.\nRegulatory \u0026amp; Legal Considerations Regulatory Requirements Regulators may require:\nProvenance documentation — Detailed provenance records Chain-of-custody maintenance — Unbroken chain-of-custody Audit access — Ability for regulators to audit provenance Retention — Provenance records retained for specified periods Responsibility: Operators must comply with regulatory requirements. Non-compliance creates legal and operational risk.\nLegal Considerations In legal proceedings:\nEvidence admissibility — Data with proper provenance is more likely to be admissible Credibility — Data with broken provenance is less credible Burden of proof — Operators may need to prove data integrity Discovery — Provenance records may be discoverable Legal risk: Data without provenance or with broken chain-of-custody may not be credible in legal proceedings.\nRelated Topics Sensor Calibration Traceability Timestamp Integrity Audit Logs \u0026amp; Immutability Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/ocean-data/provenance/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"data-provenance--chain-of-custody\"\u003eData Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData provenance is the record of where data came from, how it was created, and who handled it.

This page covers what must be recorded, how records must be maintained, and why this matters for regulatory compliance and incident investigation.\nWhy This Exists Operational records serve multiple purposes:\nRegulatory compliance — Required by IMCA, ADCI, and national regulations Incident investigation — Essential for understanding what happened and why Insurance claims — Required documentation for insurance coverage Operational improvement — Historical data informs future planning Legal defense — Proper records protect operators in disputes What can go wrong: Incomplete records, lost records, altered records, untraceable records. Each failure mode creates legal and operational risk.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors maintaining records Safety officers auditing record-keeping Regulators reviewing compliance Incident investigators reconstructing events Insurance underwriters assessing risk Legal counsel defending operations Required Records Dive Log Entries Each dive must be logged with:\nDate and time — Start time, bottom time, surface time, completion time Location — Geographic coordinates, water depth, structure/work site Diver information — Diver name, certification level, experience Depth profile — Maximum depth, depth vs. time profile Gas information — Gas mix, consumption, pressure readings Decompression — Decompression schedule, stops completed, deviations Work performed — Tasks completed, equipment used, issues encountered Environmental conditions — Current, visibility, sea state, temperature Team composition — Supervisor, standby diver, support personnel Equipment — Equipment used, equipment issues, maintenance performed Traceability: Each entry must be timestamped and attributable to a specific person. Records must be immutable once created.\nEquipment Records Equipment must be tracked:\nInspection records — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance Calibration records — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment Maintenance records — Repairs, replacements, modifications Failure records — Equipment failures, near-misses, incidents Audit-worthiness: Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.\nTraining Records Personnel qualifications must be documented:\nCertifications — Diver certifications, supervisor qualifications, medical fitness Training — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training Experience — Dive history, hours logged, types of work performed Responsibility: Operator maintains training records. Auditors verify that personnel are qualified for assigned roles.\nIncident Reports Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:\nIncident description — What happened, when, where, who was involved Causal analysis — Why it happened, contributing factors Response actions — What was done in response Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Legal sensitivity: Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate.\nRecord-Keeping Requirements Timeliness Records must be created:\nDuring operations — Real-time logging of dive parameters Immediately after — Post-dive debrief and log completion Within 24 hours — Final log entry and supervisor review What can go wrong: Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly; records must be contemporaneous.\nAccuracy Records must be accurate:\nMeasured values — Depth, time, pressure from calibrated instruments Observed values — Environmental conditions, work performed, issues encountered Attributed values — Who recorded what, when What can go wrong: Estimation instead of measurement, rounding errors, transcription errors. Accuracy matters for decompression calculations and incident investigation.\nCompleteness Records must be complete:\nAll required fields — No missing information All dives logged — No skipped dives All incidents reported — No unreported incidents What can go wrong: Incomplete records create gaps in operational history. Gaps reduce audit-worthiness and complicate incident investigation.\nImmutability Records must be immutable once created:\nNo alterations — Corrections must be documented as amendments, not changes Version control — Track all changes with timestamps and attribution Audit trail — Who changed what, when, why Legal requirement: Altered records are not credible in legal proceedings. Immutability is essential for audit-worthiness.\nData Provenance Records must demonstrate data provenance:\nSource — Where did the data come from? Instrument, observation, calculation? Method — How was the data obtained? Direct measurement, estimation, calculation? Uncertainty — What is the uncertainty in the measurement? Chain of custody — Who handled the data, when, how was it transferred? Audit-worthiness: Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors or fraud.\nStorage \u0026amp; Retention Storage Requirements Records must be stored:\nSecure storage — Protected from loss, damage, unauthorized access Backup systems — Redundant storage to prevent data loss Access control — Only authorized personnel can access records Format — Readable format that will remain accessible over time What can go wrong: Lost records, corrupted files, inaccessible formats, unauthorized access. Storage systems must be reliable and secure.\nRetention Requirements Records must be retained:\nRegulatory minimums — IMCA, ADCI, and national regulations specify retention periods Legal requirements — Statutes of limitation may require longer retention Operational value — Historical records inform future operations Typical retention: 5-7 years minimum, longer for incidents or legal proceedings. Retention policies must be documented and followed.\nDigital vs. Paper Records Digital Records Advantages:\nSearchability — Easy to search and filter Backup — Easy to create redundant copies Analysis — Easy to analyze trends and patterns Access — Easy to share with authorized personnel Challenges:\nFormat obsolescence — Formats may become unreadable over time System dependencies — Requires software and hardware to read Security — Requires cybersecurity measures Integrity — Requires cryptographic verification to prevent tampering Paper Records Advantages:\nPermanence — Readable without technology Legal acceptance — Well-established legal precedent Simplicity — No software dependencies Challenges:\nStorage — Physical space requirements Searchability — Difficult to search large volumes Backup — Requires physical copying Damage — Vulnerable to fire, water, deterioration Operational reality: Most operations use digital records with paper backup for critical documents. Hybrid approaches are common.\nAudit Requirements Records must support audits:\nRegulatory audits — IMCA, ADCI, national regulators Client audits — Contract compliance verification Insurance audits — Risk assessment and claims verification Internal audits — Quality assurance and continuous improvement Audit-worthiness: Records must be complete, accurate, traceable, and immutable.

This page covers the frameworks and considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Proper dive planning prevents incidents. By identifying hazards, assessing risks, and developing response procedures before the dive, operations can proceed with clear understanding of what can go wrong and how to respond.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning operations Commercial divers reviewing dive plans Safety officers assessing operational risk Auditors reviewing planning procedures Contractors developing operational procedures Planning Framework Hazard Identification Before planning, identify all hazards:\nEnvironmental hazards — Current, visibility, sea state, temperature, marine life Equipment hazards — Equipment failure modes, umbilical management, tool hazards Task hazards — Work complexity, confined spaces, entanglement risks Human factors — Fatigue, experience level, team composition Organizational hazards — Communication protocols, emergency response capability, support resources What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, hazards underestimated, new hazards emerge during operations. Planning must be thorough and account for uncertainty.\nRisk Assessment For each identified hazard, assess:\nLikelihood — How likely is this hazard to cause an incident? Severity — How severe would the consequences be? Mitigation — What controls reduce likelihood or severity? Residual risk — What risk remains after mitigation? Operational reality: Risk assessment is not academic. It must reflect actual operational conditions and account for how operations degrade under stress.\nControl Measures Develop control measures for each significant risk:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or procedures reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is required? What can go wrong: Controls not implemented, controls ineffective, controls degrade during operations. Controls must be practical and verifiable.\nEmergency Procedures For each significant risk, develop emergency response procedures:\nTrigger conditions — What conditions trigger emergency response? Response actions — What actions are taken in response? Responsibility — Who is responsible for each action? Communication — How is emergency communicated? Recovery — How is normal operations restored? Responsibility boundaries: Emergency procedures must clearly define who does what. Ambiguity in emergency response leads to delayed or incorrect actions.\nDive Plan Components Operational Parameters Depth — Maximum operating depth Bottom time — Planned bottom time and decompression schedule Gas requirements — Gas mix, volume, and consumption estimates Work scope — Tasks to be performed and equipment required Environmental conditions — Expected current, visibility, sea state What can go wrong: Parameters set beyond equipment or diver capabilities, environmental conditions worse than expected, work scope exceeds available time. Plans must be conservative and account for uncertainty.\nTeam Composition Diver — Primary diver qualifications and experience Standby diver — Standby diver qualifications and readiness Supervisor — Supervisor qualifications and experience Support personnel — Tenders, equipment operators, medical support Human factors: Team composition affects operational capability. Inexperienced teams require more conservative planning.\nEquipment Requirements Diving equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment Surface equipment — Gas supply, communication, monitoring, recovery Emergency equipment — Standby diver equipment, emergency gas, medical equipment Backup systems — Redundant systems for critical functions What can go wrong: Equipment not available, equipment not functional, backup systems not tested. Equipment must be verified before dive commences.\nCommunication Protocols Check-in procedures — Frequency and format of check-ins Emergency communication — How emergencies are communicated Backup communication — Alternative communication methods Surface-to-surface communication — Coordination with other operations Operational reality: Communication protocols must work in practice, not just on paper. Test communication before operations.\nRisk Assessment Methods Qualitative Risk Assessment Simple risk matrix approach:\nLikelihood: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain Severity: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic Risk level: Low, Medium, High, Extreme Use when: Quick assessment needed, resources limited, risk levels clearly distinguishable.\nWhat can go wrong: Subjective assessment, inconsistent application, risks underestimated. Requires experienced assessors.\nQuantitative Risk Assessment Numerical assessment of likelihood and consequences:\nProbability estimates — Based on historical data or expert judgment Consequence estimates — Quantified in terms of injury, equipment damage, or operational impact Risk calculation — Probability × Consequence = Risk Use when: Detailed analysis required, historical data available, regulatory requirements mandate quantitative assessment.\nWhat can go wrong: False precision, data not applicable to current conditions, calculations not understood by operational personnel. Results must be interpreted in operational context.\nALARP Assessment As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) assessment:\nIdentify all reasonably practicable controls Assess cost vs. risk reduction for each control Implement controls where risk reduction justifies cost Document why controls are or are not implemented Use when: Regulatory requirements mandate ALARP, high-risk operations, significant resources available for risk reduction.\nResponsibility: Management decides what is \u0026ldquo;reasonably practicable.\u0026rdquo; Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nPre-Dive Briefing Before dive commences, conduct briefing covering:\nDive plan review — Parameters, procedures, and emergency response Hazard review — Identified hazards and control measures Team roles — Responsibilities of each team member Communication protocols — Check-in procedures and emergency communication Equipment verification — Confirmation that all equipment is ready What can go wrong: Briefing not conducted, briefing incomplete, team members not paying attention. Briefing must be interactive and verified.\nPost-Dive Review After dive completion, review:\nPlan vs. execution — What differed from plan and why? Hazards encountered — Were all hazards identified? Any new hazards? Control effectiveness — Did controls work as intended? Lessons learned — What should be done differently next time? Operational improvement: Post-dive review drives continuous improvement. Document lessons learned and update procedures.\nRegulatory Considerations Dive planning must comply with applicable regulations:\nIMCA guidelines — International Marine Contractors Association guidelines ADCI standards — Association of Diving Contractors International standards National regulations — Country-specific requirements Client requirements — Contract-specific requirements Responsibility: Operator ensures compliance. Auditors verify compliance. Non-compliance creates legal and operational risk.\nRelated Topics Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Emergency Response Frameworks Safety, Risk \u0026amp; Compliance Human Factors in Diving Operations ","permalink":"/commercial-diving/dive-planning/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"dive-planning--risk-assessment\"\u003eDive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDive planning is the process of identifying hazards, assessing risks, and developing operational procedures before a dive commences.

Categories Single Point Failures Failures that immediately disable the system:\nPower loss — Complete loss of vehicle power Tether severance — Complete loss of connection Critical sensor failure — Loss of essential situational awareness Control system failure — Loss of vehicle control Operational impact: Mission abort, emergency recovery required.\nWhat can go wrong: No recovery possible, vehicle lost, mission failure.\nDegraded Mode Failures Failures that reduce capability but allow continued operations:\nThruster failure — Reduced maneuverability Sensor degradation — Reduced situational awareness Manipulator failure — Loss of work capability Communication degradation — Reduced data bandwidth Operational impact: Reduced capability, mission may continue with limitations.\nWhat can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nCascading Failures Initial failure leads to additional failures:\nTether damage → Power loss → Vehicle loss Thruster failure → Loss of control → Collision → Vehicle damage Sensor failure → Loss of awareness → Navigation error → Entanglement Operational impact: Rapid degradation, mission abort likely.\nWhat can go wrong: Cascading failures are difficult to predict and may progress faster than recovery procedures can execute.\nSpecific Failure Modes Power System Failures Primary power loss:\nCauses: Generator failure, tether damage, power distribution failure Effect: Immediate loss of vehicle power, unresponsive vehicle Recovery: Switch to backup power, or recover via winch if tether intact Prevention: Redundant power systems, backup generators, power monitoring Battery failure (AUV):\nCauses: Battery degradation, over-discharge, thermal issues Effect: Loss of propulsion and systems, vehicle may surface or sink Recovery: Emergency surface procedures, recovery at surface Prevention: Battery monitoring, conservative depth-of-discharge limits What can go wrong: Backup power not available, backup power insufficient, recovery procedures not executed correctly.\nCommunication Failures Tether severance (ROV):\nCauses: Snagging,

management, tension monitoring, protective routing Acoustic link loss (AUV):\nCauses: Range exceeded, acoustic interference, equipment failure Effect: Loss of real-time communication, vehicle continues mission or enters failsafe Recovery: Vehicle may surface at pre-programmed waypoint, or continue mission autonomously Prevention: Range management, acoustic link monitoring, failsafe programming What can go wrong: Emergency systems not functional, failsafe procedures not executed, vehicle lost.\nSensor Failures Camera failure:\nCauses: Water ingress, electronics failure, mechanical damage Effect: Loss of primary situational awareness Recovery: Continue with remaining cameras, or abort if no backup Prevention: Redundant cameras, watertight housings, pre-dive testing

abort if unable to clear Prevention: Thruster guards, operational awareness, careful maneuvering What can go wrong: Multiple thruster failures, asymmetric failures cause instability, recovery not possible.\nManipulator Failures Manipulator mechanical failure:\nCauses: Overload, mechanical wear, water ingress Effect: Loss of work capability, manipulator may be stuck or uncontrolled Recovery: Abort work tasks, continue inspection if possible Prevention: Load monitoring, regular maintenance, pre-dive testing Tool failure:\nCauses: Tool-specific failures (cutting tool, sampling tool, etc.) Effect: Specific work task cannot be performed Recovery: Switch to backup tool, or abort specific task Prevention: Redundant tools, tool testing, proper tool selection What can go wrong: No backup tools, tool failure causes vehicle damage, mission objectives not achievable.\nRecovery Procedures Emergency Recovery When immediate recovery is required:\nAbort mission — Cease all work tasks, prepare for recovery Assess situation — Determine recovery method based on failure mode Execute recovery — Winch recovery (ROV), surface procedures (AUV), or alternative method Secure vehicle — Once recovered, secure vehicle and assess damage Document incident — Record failure mode, recovery actions, lessons learned Responsibility: Supervisor directs recovery; pilot executes recovery procedures.\nDegraded Operations When operations can continue with limitations:\nAssess capability — Determine remaining operational capability Revise mission — Adjust mission objectives to match capability Increase monitoring — Enhanced monitoring for additional failures Prepare recovery — Ready recovery procedures in case of further degradation Document status — Record degraded status and operational limitations What can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nFailure Prevention Design Principles Redundancy — Critical systems should have backups Monitoring — Systems should monitor their own health Failsafes — Systems should fail to safe states Isolation — Failures should not cascade to other systems Operational reality: Redundancy adds cost and complexity. Tradeoffs must be made based on operational requirements and risk tolerance.\nOperational Practices Pre-dive testing — Verify all systems before deployment Regular maintenance — Prevent failures through maintenance Operational limits — Operate within system capabilities Training — Operators must understand failure modes and recovery What can go wrong: Testing incomplete, maintenance deferred, limits exceeded, training insufficient.\nData \u0026amp; Records Failure documentation must include:\nFailure description — What failed, when, under what conditions Root cause — Why it failed (if determinable) Operational impact — How operations were affected Recovery actions — What was done to recover Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Audit-worthiness: Failure records must be complete, accurate, and suitable for regulatory review.

This page covers the equipment, procedures, and operational considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Surface-supplied diving provides continuous gas supply, real-time communication, and direct surface supervision. Unlike scuba, the diver remains connected to the surface, enabling longer bottom times, better safety oversight, and support for complex work tasks.\nWho This Is For Commercial divers working surface-supplied Dive supervisors planning and overseeing operations Tenders and support personnel Safety officers reviewing procedures Auditors assessing operational compliance System Components Gas Supply System The surface gas supply provides breathing gas to the diver through an umbilical. In practice, this means:\nPrimary gas supply — Typically air or nitrox for shallow work, helium-oxygen (heliox) or trimix for deeper operations Backup gas supply — Independent secondary system with sufficient capacity for emergency ascent Gas quality monitoring — Continuous analysis of oxygen content, contaminants, and pressure Emergency gas — Bailout cylinder carried by diver for emergency ascent What can go wrong: Gas supply failure, contamination, incorrect gas mix, umbilical damage. Each failure mode requires specific response procedures documented in dive plans.\nDiving Umbilical The umbilical carries gas, communication, and sometimes power to the diver. Operational considerations:\nGas hose — Primary breathing gas supply, typically 3/8\u0026quot; to 1/2\u0026quot; ID Communication cable — Hard-wired or fiber-optic voice communication Hot water hose — For thermal protection in cold water (if applicable) Strength member — Steel wire or Kevlar strength member for load handling Umbilical management — Tending, deployment, and recovery procedures What can go wrong: Umbilical entanglement, damage from sharp edges, communication loss, gas supply interruption. Umbilical management is a critical operational skill.\nDiving Helmet or Full-Face Mask The diver\u0026rsquo;s interface with the surface-supplied system:\nHelmet systems — Hard hat with integrated communication, gas supply, and exhaust Full-face mask systems — Lighter weight alternative with similar functionality Communication — Hard-wired voice communication with surface Gas flow — Demand valve or free-flow system depending on design What can go wrong: Communication failure, mask flooding, gas flow interruption, vision obstruction. Divers must be trained in emergency procedures for each failure mode.\nDiver Monitoring Surface personnel monitor diver status through:\nVoice communication — Continuous or periodic check-ins Depth monitoring — Depth gauge or transducer on surface Gas consumption — Flow meters and pressure monitoring Visual observation — When visibility permits, direct observation from surface What can go wrong: Communication loss, depth monitoring failure, missed check-ins. Supervisors must have clear procedures for handling loss of communication.\nOperational Procedures Pre-Dive Checks Before each dive, verify:\nGas supply — Primary and backup systems operational, correct gas mix, sufficient volume Umbilical — No damage, proper routing, adequate length for planned work Communication — Two-way communication functional, backup communication available Diver equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment checked Surface support — Tender, supervisor, standby diver, emergency equipment ready Responsibility: Dive supervisor verifies surface systems; diver verifies personal equipment. Both must confirm before dive commences.\nDuring Dive Operations Standard operational practices:\nCheck-in procedures — Regular voice check-ins at specified intervals Depth/time tracking — Continuous monitoring of depth and bottom time Gas management — Monitoring consumption and remaining supply Work task execution — Following planned work procedures Umbilical management — Maintaining proper umbilical routing and avoiding entanglement What can go wrong: Task fixation leading to missed check-ins, umbilical entanglement, gas consumption exceeding plan, communication degradation. Supervisors must maintain situational awareness and intervene when necessary.\nPost-Dive Procedures After dive completion:\nEquipment recovery — Safe recovery of diver and umbilical Equipment inspection — Post-dive inspection for damage or wear Debrief — Discussion of dive execution, issues encountered, lessons learned Documentation — Recording dive details in dive log Responsibility: Supervisor ensures proper recovery and documentation; diver reports any issues or anomalies.\nFailure Modes \u0026amp; Response Communication Loss What happens: Diver cannot communicate with surface, or surface cannot hear diver.\nResponse framework:\nSurface attempts to re-establish communication If no response, initiate emergency procedures Standby diver may be deployed to locate and assist Emergency ascent procedures activated if necessary Responsibility: Supervisor initiates response; standby diver executes if deployed.\nGas Supply Failure What happens: Primary gas supply interrupted or contaminated.\nResponse framework:\nDiver switches to bailout cylinder Surface attempts to restore primary supply If restoration fails, initiate emergency ascent Standby diver may be deployed to assist Responsibility: Diver executes immediate bailout; surface supports recovery.\nUmbilical Entanglement What happens: Umbilical becomes entangled in structure or equipment.\nResponse framework:\nDiver attempts to clear entanglement Surface provides guidance and support If unable to clear, standby diver may be deployed Emergency procedures activated if diver cannot be freed Responsibility: Diver attempts self-rescue first; surface coordinates response.\nOperational Limits Surface-supplied diving has practical limits:\nDepth limits — Typically 50-60m on air, deeper with mixed gas (subject to gas mix and decompression requirements) Bottom time — Limited by decompression requirements and gas supply Work complexity — Constrained by umbilical management and communication requirements Environmental conditions — Current, visibility, and sea state affect operational feasibility What can go wrong: Operations planned beyond practical limits, environmental conditions worse than anticipated, equipment limitations not recognized. Dive planning must account for these limits.\nData \u0026amp; Records Surface-supplied diving operations generate records:\nDive logs — Depth, time, gas consumption, work performed Communication records — Voice logs (if recorded) Equipment records — Maintenance, inspection, and failure records Incident reports — Documentation of anomalies, near-misses, or incidents Audit-worthiness: Records must be traceable, timestamped, and suitable for regulatory review.

Accuracy depends on network conditions and NTP server quality.\nGPS Time GPS for precise time:\nGPS receivers — GPS receivers provide precise time Accuracy — GPS provides microsecond accuracy Reliability — GPS requires satellite visibility Independence — GPS is independent of network Operational reality: GPS is standard for systems requiring precise time. GPS requires satellite visibility, which may not be available underwater.\nHardware Timestamps Hardware-based timestamps:\nHardware clocks — Hardware clocks with battery backup Accuracy — Hardware clocks maintain accuracy when powered Independence — Hardware clocks are independent of software Limitations — Hardware clocks drift over time Operational reality: Hardware clocks provide backup when network time is unavailable, but require regular synchronization.\nTimestamp Formats ISO 8601 ISO 8601 standard format:\nFormat — YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ Timezone — UTC indicated by \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo;, or timezone offset Precision — Can include fractional seconds Standard — International standard, widely supported Operational reality: ISO 8601 is recommended for interoperability.

Verification enables audit and legal defense.\nCryptographic Verification Cryptographically verify timestamps:\nDigital signatures — Sign timestamps with digital signatures Hash chains — Use hash chains for timestamp sequences Blockchain — Use blockchain for immutable timestamps (if applicable) Trust anchors — Establish trust anchors for verification Legal requirement: Cryptographic verification provides strong evidence of timestamp integrity. Tampered timestamps cannot be verified.\nOperational Considerations Timestamp Recording Record timestamps correctly:\nAt creation — Record timestamp when data is created Not on access — Do not update timestamp on access Immutable — Timestamps must be immutable once recorded Documented — Timestamp recording must be documented What can go wrong: Timestamps recorded incorrectly, timestamps updated, timestamps not documented.

Decision visibility — Can we see system decisions? Action visibility — Can we see system actions? Sensor visibility — Can we see sensor data? What can go wrong: System not observable, critical information not logged, logs not accessible. Observability must be designed in.\nExplainability System must be explainable:\nDecision explanation — Can we explain why decisions were made? Action explanation — Can we explain why actions were taken? Failure explanation — Can we explain why failures occurred? Operational reality: Explainability is difficult for complex systems (e.g., neural networks), but essential for trust.\nTraceability System must be traceable:\nData traceability — Can we trace data to source? Decision traceability — Can we trace decisions to inputs? Action traceability — Can we trace actions to decisions? Audit requirement: Traceability enables auditors to verify system behavior and identify causes.\nVerifiability System must be verifiable:\nPost-facto verification — Can we verify behavior after the fact?
