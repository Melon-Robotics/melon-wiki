[{"content":"ALARP Principles ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable. This page covers what ALARP means in practice and how to implement it for ocean operations.\nWhy This Exists ALARP is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and a best practice in others. It provides a framework for making risk decisions that balances risk reduction with practical constraints. Understanding ALARP is essential for regulatory compliance and defensible risk management.\nWho This Is For Safety officers implementing risk management Operations managers making risk decisions Regulators reviewing risk assessments Auditors verifying ALARP compliance Legal counsel defending risk decisions ALARP Definition ALARP means reducing risk to the lowest level that is:\nTechnically feasible — Can it be done with available technology? Economically reasonable — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operationally practical — Can it be implemented in practice? Key point: ALARP is not zero risk. It is the lowest risk that is reasonably practicable given constraints.\nALARP Assessment Process Step 1: Identify All Reasonably Practicable Controls For each identified risk, identify all controls that could reasonably be implemented:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or systems reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is available? What can go wrong: Controls not identified, controls dismissed without assessment, impractical controls included. Assessment must be thorough and realistic.\nStep 2: Assess Cost vs. Risk Reduction For each control, assess:\nRisk reduction — How much does this control reduce risk? (quantified where possible) Implementation cost — What does it cost to implement? (capital, operational, maintenance) Cost-effectiveness — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operational reality: Cost includes not just money, but also operational complexity, maintenance burden, and other practical constraints.\nStep 3: Implement Controls Where Justified Implement controls where:\nRisk reduction is significant — Control meaningfully reduces risk Cost is reasonable — Cost is justified by risk reduction Implementation is practical — Control can be implemented in practice What can go wrong: Controls not implemented despite justification, controls implemented without justification, implementation incomplete. Decisions must be documented.\nStep 4: Document Decisions For each control decision, document:\nControl description — What control was considered? Risk reduction — How much risk reduction would it provide? Implementation cost — What would it cost to implement? Decision — Implement or not implement, and why Decision authority — Who made the decision? Legal requirement: ALARP decisions must be documented and defensible. Undocumented decisions create legal and regulatory risk.\nALARP Zones Intolerable Risk Risk that is unacceptable regardless of cost:\nMust be reduced — Risk must be reduced below intolerable level No cost-benefit analysis — Cost is not a factor; risk must be reduced Regulatory intervention — Regulators may prohibit operations if risk is intolerable Operational reality: Intolerable risk is rare but serious. Operations with intolerable risk should not proceed.\nALARP Zone Risk that is tolerable but should be reduced:\nMust demonstrate ALARP — Must show that risk is ALARP Cost-benefit analysis — Cost vs. risk reduction must be assessed Documentation required — Decisions must be documented Most operations fall here: Most operational risks are in the ALARP zone, requiring assessment and documentation.\nBroadly Acceptable Risk Risk that is so low that further reduction is not required:\nNo further action — No need to reduce risk further No documentation required — May not require detailed documentation Rare in practice — Most operational risks are not broadly acceptable Operational reality: Broadly acceptable risk is rare in commercial diving and subsea operations.\nPractical Implementation Risk Assessment Start with thorough risk assessment:\nIdentify hazards — All significant hazards must be identified Assess risk — Quantify risk where possible, qualitatively where not Compare to criteria — Compare risk to intolerable and broadly acceptable criteria What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, risk underestimated, criteria not applied correctly. Risk assessment must be thorough.\nControl Identification Identify all reasonably practicable controls:\nBrainstorm controls — Consider all possible controls Assess feasibility — Determine which controls are technically feasible Assess practicality — Determine which controls are operationally practical Operational reality: Control identification requires experience and creativity. External expertise may be needed.\nCost-Benefit Analysis Assess cost vs. risk reduction:\nQuantify risk reduction — How much does control reduce risk? (where possible) Quantify cost — What does control cost? (capital, operational, maintenance) Compare — Is cost justified by risk reduction? What can go wrong: Risk reduction overestimated, cost underestimated, comparison not done. Analysis must be realistic and documented.\nDecision Making Make and document decisions:\nDecision authority — Who has authority to make ALARP decisions? Decision process — What process is used to make decisions? Documentation — How are decisions documented? Responsibility: Management typically has decision authority. Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nCommon Pitfalls \u0026ldquo;We Can\u0026rsquo;t Afford It\u0026rdquo; Cost alone is not sufficient reason to not implement a control:\nMust assess — Cost must be assessed against risk reduction Must justify — Decision not to implement must be justified Must document — Justification must be documented What can go wrong: Controls dismissed based on cost without assessment, decisions not documented. Cost is a factor, but not the only factor.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Too Complex\u0026rdquo; Complexity alone is not sufficient reason:\nMust assess — Complexity must be assessed against risk reduction Must consider alternatives — Simpler alternatives may exist Must document — Decision must be documented Operational reality: Complexity is a valid constraint, but must be assessed, not assumed.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve Always Done It This Way\u0026rdquo; Tradition is not justification:\nMust assess — Existing practices must be assessed against ALARP Must improve — If better practices exist, they should be considered Must document — Decision to continue existing practice must be documented What can go wrong: Existing practices not assessed, better practices not considered, status quo assumed acceptable. ALARP requires continuous improvement.\nRegulatory Considerations Legal Requirements ALARP may be a legal requirement:\nUK regulations — ALARP is a legal requirement under UK health and safety law Other jurisdictions — Similar requirements may exist in other jurisdictions Industry standards — IMCA, DNV, and other standards may require ALARP Responsibility: Operators must comply with legal requirements. Non-compliance creates legal risk.\nRegulatory Review Regulators may review ALARP assessments:\nDocumentation review — Regulators may review ALARP documentation Decision challenge — Regulators may challenge ALARP decisions Enforcement — Non-compliance may result in enforcement action Audit-worthiness: ALARP documentation must be suitable for regulatory review. Inadequate documentation creates regulatory risk.\nRelated Topics Operational Risk Models Hazard Identification (HAZID/HAZOP) Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/safety-compliance/alarp/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"alarp-principles\"\u003eALARP Principles\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable.

In subsea operations, audit logs support incident investigation, regulatory compliance, and data integrity verification.\nWhy This Exists Raw data and derived products are only trustworthy if the chain of custody can be proven. Audit logs provide the evidence trail. Without tamper-evident logs, data can be altered after the fact — intentionally or accidentally — and the alteration cannot be detected. Regulatory bodies and legal proceedings require that evidence of data integrity be demonstrable.\nWho This Is For Data managers designing data storage and access systems Safety officers investigating incidents Regulators reviewing operational records Legal and compliance teams responding to disputes or incidents What Audit Logs Must Record A complete audit log entry records:\nTimestamp — When the event occurred (UTC, with sub-second precision where relevant) Actor — Who or what performed the action (user ID, system ID, software version) Action — What was done (create, read, update, delete, export) Object — What was acted upon (file path, record ID, dataset name) Source address — Where the action originated (IP address, terminal ID) Result — Whether the action succeeded or failed Context — Any relevant operational context (dive ID, deployment ID) Immutability Requirements Append-Only Design Audit logs must be append-only: entries can be added but not modified or deleted. Systems that allow modification or deletion of audit log entries are not audit logs — they are records that can be falsified.\nImplementation options:\nWrite-once storage media Cryptographic chaining (each entry includes a hash of the previous entry) Append-only log services with access controls preventing modification Offsite replication to an independent system Cryptographic Chaining Each log entry can include a cryptographic hash of the previous entry, creating a chain. Altering any entry breaks all subsequent hashes, making tampering detectable:\nEntry N: { data, hash(Entry N-1) } Entry N+1: { data, hash(Entry N) } This structure is the basis of blockchain-style data integrity, applied here without the distributed consensus overhead.\nTimestamping Timestamps must come from a trusted, authoritative source:\nNTP-synchronised clocks — Synchronised to a trusted time server GPS time — For systems deployed at sea where NTP may be unavailable Third-party timestamping — Cryptographic timestamps from a trusted authority prove data existed at a particular time Log Retention and Access Retention Periods Retention requirements vary by jurisdiction and data type:\nOperational logs — Typically 2–5 years Incident-related records — Often retained indefinitely pending investigation closure Environmental data — May have regulatory-defined retention periods Organisations must define and enforce retention policies. Automatic deletion before retention periods expire must be prevented.\nAccess Controls Access to audit logs must itself be logged:\nReading logs is an auditable action Administrators who can manage log systems must not be able to delete entries Separation of duties: those who generate data should not be the sole custodians of that data\u0026rsquo;s logs Operational Context Dive Operations For diving operations, audit logs should capture:\nGas mix preparation and verification sign-offs Dive supervisor authorisation entries In-water communication transcripts (or references to recordings) Equipment inspection completion records Any deviations from the approved dive plan ROV/AUV Operations For autonomous and remotely operated vehicles:\nMission file versions and upload timestamps Parameter changes made during operations Sensor data file creation and transfer records Operator intervention events Integration with Data Provenance Audit logs and data provenance are related but distinct:\nAudit logs — Record system events and user actions Data provenance — Track the lineage of data products (where data came from and how it was processed) Both are required for full accountability.

Rules written for human divers, remotely operated vehicles with continuous operator control, or surface vessels with crews do not map cleanly onto systems that make independent decisions in real time. This page examines where legacy assumptions break down and what that means for operations, liability, and standards development.\nWhy This Exists Deploying autonomous systems without understanding the gaps in applicable frameworks creates legal, regulatory, and operational risk. Organisations must identify which assumptions underlie their regulatory compliance posture and whether those assumptions still hold when the system acts autonomously.\nWho This Is For Engineers designing autonomous subsea systems Legal and compliance teams reviewing regulatory applicability Standards bodies developing new frameworks Project managers identifying regulatory risks before deployment What Makes Autonomy Different Continuous Human Control Assumption Most existing regulations for subsea vehicles assume a human operator is continuously monitoring and controlling the vehicle. Regulations specify:\n\u0026ldquo;The operator shall ensure…\u0026rdquo; — Who is the operator of an AUV completing a long-duration mission? \u0026ldquo;The pilot shall maintain…\u0026rdquo; — An autonomous vehicle has no pilot Response time requirements — An AUV operating beyond acoustic communication range cannot respond to real-time commands Gap: Regulations that specify continuous operator control are unenforceable for, and inapplicable to, truly autonomous systems.\nDefined Operating Area Assumption ROV regulations assume the vehicle operates in a defined, known, and cleared area within the umbilical\u0026rsquo;s reach. AUVs may traverse large areas including:\nRegions not cleared for operations Areas with unknown hazards Zones where other operations are underway Gap: Safe area definitions and exclusion zones designed for tethered operations do not account for autonomous navigation through variable terrain.\nImmediate Abort Capability Assumption Emergency procedures in existing frameworks assume operations can be halted immediately on command. An AUV:\nMay be beyond acoustic communication range May be executing a manoeuvre that cannot be safely interrupted May experience communication loss at a critical moment Gap: Emergency stop requirements presuppose communication that autonomous systems cannot guarantee.\nLiability and Accountability Gaps Distributed Decision-Making When an autonomous system makes a decision that results in an incident, attributing responsibility is complex:\nDesigner — Did the system behave as specified? Operator — Was the mission planned appropriately? Programmer — Was the decision logic correct? Certifier — Was the system properly assessed before deployment? Existing liability frameworks typically assign responsibility to an operator/employer. They do not describe how to assign liability when the decision was made by an algorithm.\nSoftware as Evidence If an autonomous vehicle is involved in an incident, the software state at the time of the incident is critical evidence. This requires:\nLogging of all autonomous decisions with sufficient context to reconstruct the decision process Version control and immutable deployment records Black-box equivalent capabilities for autonomous vehicles See Why Auditability Matters for the logging requirements that follow from this.\nLegacy Assumptions in Standards Manned Submersible Rules Applied to AUVs Some regulators apply manned submersible rules to AUVs because no AUV-specific rules exist. This creates:\nOver-specified requirements (life support systems for a vehicle with no crew) Under-specified requirements (no guidance on autonomous decision-making) Arbitrary interpretations that vary by jurisdiction and inspector ROV Rules Applied to AUVs ROV rules typically require:\nContinuous surface monitoring Umbilical as a physical lifeline Defined safe areas matching the umbilical radius None of these translate to AUV operations. Applying ROV rules to AUVs either prevents AUV operations entirely or forces fictitious compliance.\nPaths Forward New Regulatory Categories Effective frameworks will likely need separate regulatory categories for:\nFully supervised ROVs (existing frameworks apply) Supervised AUVs (periodic communication required) Extended autonomous AUVs (pre-mission approval model) Persistent autonomous systems (continuous environmental monitoring) Performance-Based vs Prescriptive Standards Prescriptive standards (do X, use Y) cannot anticipate autonomous system designs. Performance-based standards (achieve outcome Z, demonstrate how) allow innovation while maintaining safety objectives. The challenge is defining measurable performance criteria for autonomous behaviour.\nRelated Topics Why Auditability Matters Gaps in Current Standards Open Problems in Subsea Operations Failure Modes \u0026amp; Recovery Loss-of-Comms Behavior ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/open-standards/autonomy-challenges/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"autonomy-challenges--legacy-assumptions\"\u003eAutonomy Challenges \u0026amp; Legacy Assumptions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutonomous subsea systems operate in ways that existing regulatory frameworks were not designed to accommodate.

Records must be immutable once created — corrections require amendment notes, not erasures.\nEquipment Records Equipment must be tracked:\nInspection records — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance, out-of-service events Calibration records — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment, O2 analyzers Maintenance records — Repairs, replacements, modifications with part numbers and dates Failure records — Equipment failures, near-misses, corrective actions taken Audit-worthiness: Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.\nTraining Records Personnel qualifications must be documented:\nCertifications — Diver certifications (ADCI, IMCA, HSE, or equivalent), supervisor qualifications, medical fitness certificates Training history — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training, emergency drills Dive history — Cumulative dive hours, types of operations, specific qualifications (bell diving, saturation, etc.) Incident Reports Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:\nIncident description — What happened, when, where, who was involved Causal analysis — Why it happened, contributing factors, root cause Response actions — What was done in response, immediate and follow-up Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Legal sensitivity: Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate. Do not speculate or assign blame — describe what happened and what was done.\nRecord-Keeping Requirements Timeliness Records must be created:\nDuring operations — Real-time logging of depth, time, and gas data Immediately after — Post-dive debrief, decompression completion, supervisor countersignature Within 24 hours — Final log review, incident notification if required What can go wrong: Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly — records must be contemporaneous to be credible in investigation or litigation.\nAccuracy Records must use measured values, not estimates:\nDepth — From calibrated depth gauge, not estimated Time — From synchronized timepieces, not reconstructed Gas — Analyzed O2%, not assumed from cylinder label Pressure — From calibrated gauges, with before/after readings Completeness All required fields completed — no blank mandatory fields All dives logged — no skipped entries regardless of dive duration All decompression stops recorded with actual times, not planned times Immutability Records must be immutable once signed:\nNo overwriting — Errors corrected with a single line strike-through, initialed and dated Amendment process — Significant corrections require a separate amendment note with reason, date, and signature No backdating — All entries dated and timed at creation Data Provenance Records must demonstrate data provenance:\nSource — Where did the data originate? Instrument? Observation? Calculation? Method — Direct measurement, estimation, or derived value? Chain of custody — Who recorded the data, who verified it, how was it transferred? Audit-worthiness: Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors. Records that cannot be traced to a source are not credible.\nStorage \u0026amp; Retention Storage Requirements Secure storage — Protected from loss, damage, fire, water, and unauthorized access Backup — Redundant copies in separate physical locations or cloud storage with access controls Access control — Only authorized personnel can view or modify records Format — Readable format that will remain accessible for the full retention period Retention Periods Record Type Minimum Retention Basis Dive logs (routine) 5 years IMCA M 103, ADCI Equipment inspection records 5 years or equipment life Manufacturer / regulator Training \u0026amp; certification records Duration of employment + 5 years Standard practice Incident reports Indefinite Statute of limitations Personal injury records Indefinite Legal requirement Gas analysis records 5 years Standard practice Operational reality: Many jurisdictions and contracts require retention beyond these minimums. When in doubt, retain longer.\nDigital vs. Paper Records Digital records — Advantages: searchable, easily backed up, can support audit trails, integrates with decompression software. Challenges: format obsolescence, system dependencies, cybersecurity requirements, integrity verification.\nPaper records — Advantages: universally readable, legally established, no technology dependency. Challenges: physical storage, difficult to search at scale, backup requires physical copying.\nBest practice: Dual records (digital primary, paper backup for critical dives) provide the advantages of both. The paper record must be a faithful copy of the digital record, not a summary.\nAudit Requirements Records must support the following audit types:\nRegulatory audits — IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, flag state, coastal state Client audits — Third-party verification of contract compliance Insurance audits — Risk assessment and claims verification Internal audits — Quality assurance and continuous improvement What auditors look for: Complete entries, supervisor signatures, calibration records, training records cross-referenced to personnel, gas analysis certificates, incident report trails. Gaps in any of these create audit findings.\nFrequently Asked Questions What must be in a commercial diving log? Every commercial dive log entry must include: date and times (start, max depth, surfaced), GPS location, diver identity and certification, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2%, decompression schedule followed and any deviations, work performed, environmental conditions, and supervisor signature. See the printable template above for a complete field reference.\nHow long must records be kept? Minimum 5 years for routine logs (IMCA/ADCI). Indefinite for incident reports and records involving personal injury. Many operators keep all records for 7-10 years. Check your contract, your jurisdiction, and your insurer\u0026rsquo;s requirements — they may be more stringent.\nWhat makes a record legally defensible? Contemporaneous creation (not reconstructed from memory), measured values from calibrated instruments, complete required fields, supervisor countersignature, immutable storage with audit trail.

This page covers acoustic, RF, and hybrid communication systems, their capabilities, limitations, and failure modes.\nWhy This Exists Communication enables coordination, control, and data transfer in subsea operations. Understanding communication options, tradeoffs, and failure modes is essential for designing and operating multi-vehicle systems.\nWho This Is For Robotics engineers designing communication systems Operations managers planning multi-vehicle operations ROV pilots operating in communication-limited environments System architects designing networked systems Communication Options Acoustic Communication Acoustic modems use sound waves to transmit data through water:\nRange — Typically 1-10km depending on frequency and power Bandwidth — Low bandwidth (typically \u0026lt;10 kbps) Latency — High latency (speed of sound in water ~1500 m/s) Reliability — Affected by noise, multipath, and environmental conditions Operational reality: Acoustic communication is the standard for long-range subsea communication, but it is slow and unreliable.\nWhat can go wrong: Communication loss due to range, noise, multipath, equipment failure. Acoustic communication is inherently unreliable.\nRF Communication Radio frequency communication through water:\nRange — Very limited (typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater) Bandwidth — Higher bandwidth than acoustic (typically 100+ kbps) Latency — Low latency (speed of light) Reliability — Good reliability at short range Operational reality: RF is only practical at very short range. Seawater is highly conductive, severely limiting RF range.\nWhat can go wrong: Range exceeded, interference, equipment failure. RF is not practical for most subsea operations.\nHybrid Systems Combining acoustic and RF:\nAcoustic for long-range — Use acoustic for vehicle-to-surface or vehicle-to-vehicle at range RF for short-range — Use RF for high-bandwidth at short range Automatic switching — Switch between systems based on range and requirements Operational reality: Hybrid systems provide best of both worlds, but add complexity.\nWhat can go wrong: Switching failures, system complexity, increased failure modes. Hybrid systems must be carefully designed.\nTether (ROV) Hard-wired connection for ROVs:\nRange — Limited by tether length (typically \u0026lt;1000m) Bandwidth — Very high bandwidth (fiber optic) Latency — Very low latency Reliability — High reliability if tether intact Operational reality: Tether provides best communication but limits vehicle mobility and range.\nWhat can go wrong: Tether damage, tether length limitations, entanglement. Tether is not practical for all operations.\nCommunication Characteristics Latency Communication latency affects:\nReal-time control — High latency makes real-time control difficult Coordination — High latency affects coordination capability Data freshness — High latency means data is stale when received Operational reality: Acoustic latency (speed of sound) is ~0.67 seconds per kilometer. At 5km range, round-trip latency is ~6.7 seconds. This is too slow for real-time control.\nBandwidth Communication bandwidth affects:\nData transfer — How much data can be transferred Video feeds — High-bandwidth required for video Sensor data — Bandwidth limits sensor data transfer Operational reality: Acoustic bandwidth is typically \u0026lt;10 kbps, insufficient for video. RF provides higher bandwidth but limited range.\nReliability Communication reliability affects:\nMission success — Unreliable communication may cause mission failure Safety — Unreliable communication creates safety risk Coordination — Unreliable communication makes coordination difficult What can go wrong: Communication loss, intermittent communication, degraded communication. Systems must be designed for unreliable communication.\nFailure Modes Range Exceeded Communication lost because range exceeded:\nAcoustic — Range typically 1-10km depending on conditions RF — Range typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater Tether — Range limited by tether length Response: Vehicle must operate autonomously when communication lost. See Loss-of-Comms Behavior .\nEnvironmental Interference Communication degraded by environmental conditions:\nAcoustic noise — Ship noise, biological noise, other acoustic sources Multipath — Acoustic signals reflected off surfaces Attenuation — Signal strength reduced by distance and conditions What can go wrong: Communication degraded or lost due to environmental conditions.

See Graceful Degradation .\nCommunication Protocols Message-Based Protocols Send discrete messages:\nAdvantages — Simple, robust to loss, works with low bandwidth Disadvantages — No continuous data streams, higher overhead Operational reality: Message-based protocols are common for acoustic communication due to low bandwidth and high latency.\nStream-Based Protocols Continuous data streams:\nAdvantages — Efficient for continuous data, lower overhead Disadvantages — Requires reliable connection, not suitable for low bandwidth Operational reality: Stream-based protocols are used for tethered systems with high bandwidth and low latency.\nHybrid Protocols Combine message-based and stream-based:\nMessages for control — Use messages for commands and status Streams for data — Use streams for high-bandwidth data when available Operational reality: Hybrid protocols provide flexibility but add complexity.\nOperational Considerations Communication Planning Plan communication for operations:\nRange requirements — What range is needed? Bandwidth requirements — What bandwidth is needed? Latency requirements — What latency is acceptable? Reliability requirements — What reliability is needed? What can go wrong: Communication not planned, requirements not met, backup not available. Communication planning is essential.\nBackup Communication Provide backup communication:\nMultiple systems — Acoustic and RF, or multiple acoustic systems Redundant equipment — Backup modems and antennas Alternative methods — Surface-to-surface coordination, visual signals Operational reality: Backup communication is essential. Single point of failure is unacceptable.\nAutonomous Operation Vehicles must operate autonomously:\nWhen communication lost — Vehicle continues mission autonomously When communication degraded — Vehicle adapts to available communication Pre-programmed behavior — Vehicle follows pre-programmed procedures Responsibility: Vehicle designers must ensure autonomous capability.

In simulation-based training, poorly calibrated confidence is a serious hazard: operators who are overconfident will take risks they are not equipped to handle; operators who are underconfident will hesitate when decisive action is needed.\nWhy This Exists Simulation training creates a risk that is not present in apprenticeship-based training: the trainee may perform well in simulation without that performance transferring to the real environment. If trainees exit training believing they are more capable than they are, the training has created a hazard rather than eliminating one.\nWho This Is For Training designers building simulation curricula Instructors assessing trainee readiness Operations managers making deployment decisions Safety officers reviewing training programme effectiveness What Is Confidence Calibration? A well-calibrated operator:\nCorrectly identifies situations they can handle competently Correctly identifies situations that exceed their current capability Knows when to ask for assistance or defer to more experienced colleagues Adjusts confidence appropriately as experience accumulates Overconfidence: Performance is worse than the operator believes. This is more dangerous — the operator takes on situations they cannot handle safely.\nUnderconfidence: Performance is better than the operator believes. This is less dangerous but reduces operational efficiency and may prevent deployment of a competent operator.\nMeasuring Confidence Calibration Self-Assessment vs. Objective Performance Calibration is measured by comparing:\nSubjective confidence — How certain is the operator that they can perform a task correctly? Objective performance — How well do they actually perform the task? If an operator says \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m 90% confident I can complete this task\u0026rdquo; and completes it correctly 90% of the time across many trials, they are well-calibrated for that task.\nCalibration Methods Scenario-based assessment: Present the operator with scenarios of varying difficulty. Before each, ask for confidence rating. After each, assess performance. Plot confidence vs. performance.\nKnowledge questions: Present questions about procedures, limits, and emergency actions. Ask for confidence in each answer. Score the answers. Compare.\nJudgment tasks: Ask operators to assess whether a simulated situation is within limits. Compare judgments to correct answers.\nFactors That Distort Confidence Simulator Fidelity Gaps If the simulator is easier than reality (smoother controls, cleaner sensor data, more forgiving physics), operators may perform well in simulation without real capability. They exit training overconfident.\nMitigation: Introduce realistic noise, failure modes, and environmental variability in simulation. See Physics vs Control Realism .\nLack of Failure Consequences In simulation, failure is safe. This can reduce the psychological pressure that affects real performance. Operators may perform better in simulation than they would in a real emergency.\nMitigation: Structured debriefs that emphasise what would have happened in reality; progressive assessment of performance under simulated pressure.\nInstructor Feedback Effects Positive instructor feedback can inflate confidence. Critical feedback without performance data can deflate it unnecessarily.\nMitigation: Feedback should be based on objective performance metrics, not instructor impression. Distinguish between praise for effort (appropriate) and claims about competence (must be evidence-based).\nCalibration in Training Programmes Entry Assessment Assess baseline confidence and performance at programme entry:\nIdentifies trainees with prior experience that may or may not match their confidence Sets a baseline for measuring programme effectiveness Progressive Calibration Checkpoints Throughout training:\nRegular calibration assessments as capability is built Trainees should see their confidence and performance data together Instructors should intervene when significant miscalibration is detected Certification Readiness Assessment Before certification:\nFull calibration assessment across the scope of the certification Trainees must demonstrate not just performance but appropriate confidence in that performance Significant overconfidence should delay certification even if raw performance meets criteria Calibration for New Technology When operators are transitioning to new systems (e.g., from manual ROV operation to autonomy-assisted operation), confidence calibration is especially important:\nPrior experience may create false confidence about new system behaviour New failure modes may not be intuited from old experience Performance in the new system must be specifically assessed before deployment Related Topics Why Simulation Matters Physics vs Control Realism Pre-Mission Rehearsal Digital Twins Human Factors in Diving Operations ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/simulation-training/confidence/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"confidence-calibration\"\u003eConfidence Calibration\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfidence calibration is the process of measuring whether operator confidence in their abilities matches their actual performance.

(calibration coefficients, filter settings, algorithm version) Transformation time — When was the transformation applied? Transformation system — What system performed the transformation? What can go wrong: Transformations not documented, transformation parameters lost, transformations applied incorrectly.

This page covers the operational aspects: what causes decompression sickness, how dive tables encode safe ascent profiles, and how to apply the theory in practice.\nWhy This Exists Every diver working with compressed gas at depth is subject to decompression obligations. Understanding the theory behind those obligations allows supervisors and divers to plan dives safely, recognize when tables apply, and respond appropriately when exposures exceed planned limits.\nWho This Is For Diving supervisors planning and approving dive plans Commercial divers understanding their decompression obligations Safety officers reviewing dive plans and incident reports Medical staff treating potential decompression sickness Inert Gas Uptake and Elimination How Gas Enters Tissues When breathing compressed gas at depth, inert gas (nitrogen or helium) dissolves into tissues under pressure. The amount dissolved depends on:\nPartial pressure of the gas — Higher pressure = more gas dissolved Time at depth — Tissues absorb gas at different rates (compartments) Tissue type — Different tissues (blood, fat, muscle) absorb and release gas at different rates Tissue Compartments Decompression models use multiple theoretical tissue compartments with different half-times:\nFast compartments (e.g., 5-minute half-time) — Absorb and release gas quickly; limiting at shorter exposures Slow compartments (e.g., 120-minute half-time) — Absorb gas slowly but retain it for longer; limiting for repetitive or long dives Operational implication: The slowest compartment that has absorbed significant gas determines the required decompression.\nSupersaturation and Bubble Formation During ascent, pressure decreases and inert gas comes out of solution. If ascent is too fast, gas forms bubbles in tissues and blood — the cause of decompression sickness (DCS).\nTolerated supersaturation: Tissues can tolerate some level of supersaturation without forming symptomatic bubbles. Decompression tables are designed to keep supersaturation within tolerable limits.\nUSN Decompression Model The U.S. Navy Diving Manual uses the Workman M-value model:\nM-values define the maximum tolerable inert gas pressure in each tissue compartment at each ambient pressure Decompression stops are required whenever inert gas pressure in any compartment approaches its M-value during ascent Tables encode pre-calculated ascent profiles that keep all compartments within safe limits Table Structure USN dive tables are organized by:\nBottom depth — Maximum depth reached during the dive Bottom time — Time from leaving the surface until beginning ascent Repetitive group — Letter designation indicating residual nitrogen carried into the next dive No-Decompression Limits (NDL) The NDL is the maximum time a diver can remain at a given depth and ascend directly to the surface without required decompression stops. Exceeding the NDL creates an obligatory decompression stop requirement.\nSee No-Decompression Limits (Tables 9-7 \u0026amp; 2A-1) for specific USN NDL values.\nDecompression Stop Procedures When a dive exceeds the NDL:\nBegin ascent at the prescribed rate (typically 9 m/min or 30 ft/min) Stop at the first required decompression stop depth Wait the prescribed time at each stop Ascend to the next stop (or surface) after completing each stop time Do not skip or shorten stops Stop breathing gas: For air dives, stops are performed breathing air. Oxygen-enriched gas at stops accelerates inert gas elimination.\nRepetitive Diving Residual nitrogen from a previous dive adds to inert gas loading on subsequent dives. USN tables account for this through:\nRepetitive group letters — Track residual nitrogen after a dive Surface interval credit — Nitrogen eliminated during surface intervals is credited Residual nitrogen time — Added to actual bottom time for table entry on the second dive Operational rule: Always calculate cumulative nitrogen loading for multiple-dive days.\nDecompression Sickness Recognition Type I (Musculoskeletal/Skin) Joint pain (\u0026ldquo;the bends\u0026rdquo;) Skin mottling (cutis marmorata) Lymphatic swelling Type II (Neurological/Cardiopulmonary) Weakness, paralysis, numbness Visual disturbances Respiratory distress (\u0026ldquo;chokes\u0026rdquo;) Loss of consciousness Any DCS symptoms require immediate recompression treatment.

For subsea operations, digital twins can represent vehicles, structures, environmental conditions, and operations. They support simulation, condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and training in ways that static models cannot.\nWhy This Exists Physical assets operating in the subsea environment are expensive to inspect and difficult to access. A digital twin provides a continuously updated representation of the asset\u0026rsquo;s state, making it possible to monitor performance, detect degradation, plan maintenance, and train operators without repeated physical access.\nWho This Is For Engineers designing digital twin systems for subsea assets Operations managers using digital twins for planning and monitoring Training designers building high-fidelity training environments Data managers integrating sensor data with asset models What Makes a Digital Twin A digital twin has three components:\nPhysical asset — The real-world system being modelled Digital model — A computational representation of the asset Data connection — Sensor data flowing from the physical asset to update the model Without the data connection, it is a simulation model, not a digital twin. The defining characteristic is real-time or near-real-time synchronisation between physical and digital.\nTypes of Digital Twins in Subsea Operations Vehicle Twins A digital twin of an ROV or AUV models:\nVehicle dynamics (hydrodynamics, thruster response) Sensor suite (coverage, accuracy, noise characteristics) Power system state (battery charge, consumption rates) Fault state (which systems are healthy, degraded, or failed) Applications:\nPre-mission rehearsal with accurate vehicle behaviour Mission planning (endurance, sensor coverage) Fault diagnosis (comparing actual vs. expected behaviour) Maintenance prediction (power consumption trends indicating degradation) Structure Twins A digital twin of a subsea structure (pipeline, riser, manifold) models:\nStructural integrity and stress state Corrosion rates and protection system performance Inspection history and known defects Environmental loading Applications:\nCondition monitoring without every inspection requiring physical access Anomaly detection (comparing sensor readings with model predictions) Maintenance planning based on modelled degradation rates Environmental Twins A digital twin of the marine environment models:\nCurrent profiles and variability Seabed topography Water column properties (temperature, salinity, acoustic velocity) Applications:\nMission planning for vehicles operating in complex environments Training scenarios with realistic environmental conditions Communication planning (acoustic propagation modelling) Keeping Twins Current Data Ingestion Digital twins must ingest data from sensors on the physical asset:\nReal-time streaming — For continuous monitoring applications Batch updates — After inspection events, incorporating new inspection findings Hybrid — Continuous monitoring supplemented by periodic high-resolution updates Model Updating As new data arrives, the model must be updated:\nState estimation — Use sensor data to update the modelled state of the asset Parameter estimation — Update model parameters as behaviour deviates from predictions Uncertainty tracking — Model uncertainty grows between data updates and shrinks when new data arrives Model Validation A digital twin is only useful if it accurately represents the physical asset. Validation requires:\nComparing model predictions with independent measurements Tracking prediction error over time Updating or revalidating the model when significant deviations occur Digital Twins for Training High-fidelity digital twins of operational assets provide training environments that are:\nAccurate to the specific asset — Not a generic model but the actual asset being operated Current — Reflects the current state of the asset including known defects and modifications Safe — Operators can train on realistic failure scenarios without risk Requirement: Training twins must be explicitly marked and controlled to ensure trainees do not confuse training scenarios with operational reality.\nData Integration Challenges Data Quality Digital twins are only as good as the data feeding them. Poor sensor calibration, missing data, and data integrity issues degrade twin accuracy. See Sensor Calibration Traceability and Raw vs Derived Data .\nData Latency The value of a digital twin depends in part on how current it is. High-latency data connections (acoustic modems, satellite uplinks) limit how often the twin can be updated.\nModel-Reality Divergence Models become less accurate over time as the physical asset changes (corrosion, modifications, damage) in ways the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture.

This page covers the frameworks and considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Proper dive planning prevents incidents. By identifying hazards, assessing risks, and developing response procedures before the dive, operations can proceed with clear understanding of what can go wrong and how to respond.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning operations Commercial divers reviewing dive plans Safety officers assessing operational risk Auditors reviewing planning procedures Contractors developing operational procedures Planning Framework Hazard Identification Before planning, identify all hazards:\nEnvironmental hazards — Current, visibility, sea state, temperature, marine life Equipment hazards — Equipment failure modes, umbilical management, tool hazards Task hazards — Work complexity, confined spaces, entanglement risks Human factors — Fatigue, experience level, team composition Organizational hazards — Communication protocols, emergency response capability, support resources What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, hazards underestimated, new hazards emerge during operations. Planning must be thorough and account for uncertainty.\nRisk Assessment For each identified hazard, assess:\nLikelihood — How likely is this hazard to cause an incident? Severity — How severe would the consequences be? Mitigation — What controls reduce likelihood or severity? Residual risk — What risk remains after mitigation? Operational reality: Risk assessment is not academic. It must reflect actual operational conditions and account for how operations degrade under stress.\nControl Measures Develop control measures for each significant risk:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or procedures reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is required? What can go wrong: Controls not implemented, controls ineffective, controls degrade during operations. Controls must be practical and verifiable.\nEmergency Procedures For each significant risk, develop emergency response procedures:\nTrigger conditions — What conditions trigger emergency response? Response actions — What actions are taken in response? Responsibility — Who is responsible for each action? Communication — How is emergency communicated? Recovery — How is normal operations restored? Responsibility boundaries: Emergency procedures must clearly define who does what. Ambiguity in emergency response leads to delayed or incorrect actions.\nDive Plan Components Operational Parameters Depth — Maximum operating depth Bottom time — Planned bottom time and decompression schedule Gas requirements — Gas mix, volume, and consumption estimates Work scope — Tasks to be performed and equipment required Environmental conditions — Expected current, visibility, sea state What can go wrong: Parameters set beyond equipment or diver capabilities, environmental conditions worse than expected, work scope exceeds available time. Plans must be conservative and account for uncertainty.\nTeam Composition Diver — Primary diver qualifications and experience Standby diver — Standby diver qualifications and readiness Supervisor — Supervisor qualifications and experience Support personnel — Tenders, equipment operators, medical support Human factors: Team composition affects operational capability. Inexperienced teams require more conservative planning.\nEquipment Requirements Diving equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment Surface equipment — Gas supply, communication, monitoring, recovery Emergency equipment — Standby diver equipment, emergency gas, medical equipment Backup systems — Redundant systems for critical functions What can go wrong: Equipment not available, equipment not functional, backup systems not tested. Equipment must be verified before dive commences.\nCommunication Protocols Check-in procedures — Frequency and format of check-ins Emergency communication — How emergencies are communicated Backup communication — Alternative communication methods Surface-to-surface communication — Coordination with other operations Operational reality: Communication protocols must work in practice, not just on paper. Test communication before operations.\nRisk Assessment Methods Qualitative Risk Assessment Simple risk matrix approach:\nLikelihood: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain Severity: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic Risk level: Low, Medium, High, Extreme Use when: Quick assessment needed, resources limited, risk levels clearly distinguishable.\nWhat can go wrong: Subjective assessment, inconsistent application, risks underestimated. Requires experienced assessors.\nQuantitative Risk Assessment Numerical assessment of likelihood and consequences:\nProbability estimates — Based on historical data or expert judgment Consequence estimates — Quantified in terms of injury, equipment damage, or operational impact Risk calculation — Probability × Consequence = Risk Use when: Detailed analysis required, historical data available, regulatory requirements mandate quantitative assessment.\nWhat can go wrong: False precision, data not applicable to current conditions, calculations not understood by operational personnel. Results must be interpreted in operational context.\nALARP Assessment As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) assessment:\nIdentify all reasonably practicable controls Assess cost vs. risk reduction for each control Implement controls where risk reduction justifies cost Document why controls are or are not implemented Use when: Regulatory requirements mandate ALARP, high-risk operations, significant resources available for risk reduction.\nResponsibility: Management decides what is \u0026ldquo;reasonably practicable.\u0026rdquo; Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nPre-Dive Briefing Before dive commences, conduct briefing covering:\nDive plan review — Parameters, procedures, and emergency response Hazard review — Identified hazards and control measures Team roles — Responsibilities of each team member Communication protocols — Check-in procedures and emergency communication Equipment verification — Confirmation that all equipment is ready What can go wrong: Briefing not conducted, briefing incomplete, team members not paying attention. Briefing must be interactive and verified.\nPost-Dive Review After dive completion, review:\nPlan vs. execution — What differed from plan and why? Hazards encountered — Were all hazards identified? Any new hazards? Control effectiveness — Did controls work as intended? Lessons learned — What should be done differently next time? Operational improvement: Post-dive review drives continuous improvement. Document lessons learned and update procedures.\nRegulatory Considerations Dive planning must comply with applicable regulations:\nIMCA guidelines — International Marine Contractors Association guidelines ADCI standards — Association of Diving Contractors International standards National regulations — Country-specific requirements Client requirements — Contract-specific requirements Responsibility: Operator ensures compliance.

Decision criteria — What criteria guide emergency decisions? Escalation — When are decisions escalated? Documentation — How are emergency decisions documented? Operational reality: Emergency decisions must be made quickly. Decision-making authority must be clear and documented.\nResource Availability Emergency response requires resources:\nPersonnel — Trained personnel available for response Equipment — Emergency equipment ready and functional Communication — Communication systems for coordination Medical — Medical support available (if applicable) What can go wrong: Resources not available, resources not ready, resources not sufficient.

pilots and supervisors Operations managers planning missions Safety officers assessing operational risk Robotics engineers designing systems Auditors reviewing operational procedures Failure Mode Categories Single Point Failures Failures that immediately disable the system:\nPower loss — Complete loss of vehicle power Tether severance — Complete loss of connection Critical sensor failure — Loss of essential situational awareness Control system failure — Loss of vehicle control Operational impact: Mission abort, emergency recovery required.\nWhat can go wrong: No recovery possible, vehicle lost, mission failure.\nDegraded Mode Failures Failures that reduce capability but allow continued operations:\nThruster failure — Reduced maneuverability Sensor degradation — Reduced situational awareness Manipulator failure — Loss of work capability Communication degradation — Reduced data bandwidth Operational impact: Reduced capability, mission may continue with limitations.\nWhat can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nCascading Failures Initial failure leads to additional failures:\nTether damage → Power loss → Vehicle loss Thruster failure → Loss of control → Collision → Vehicle damage Sensor failure → Loss of awareness → Navigation error → Entanglement Operational impact: Rapid degradation, mission abort likely.\nWhat can go wrong: Cascading failures are difficult to predict and may progress faster than recovery procedures can execute.\nSpecific Failure Modes Power System Failures Primary power loss:\nCauses: Generator failure, tether damage, power distribution failure Effect: Immediate loss of vehicle power, unresponsive vehicle Recovery: Switch to backup power, or recover via winch if tether intact Prevention: Redundant power systems, backup generators, power monitoring Battery failure (AUV):\nCauses: Battery degradation, over-discharge, thermal issues Effect: Loss of propulsion and systems, vehicle may surface or sink Recovery: Emergency surface procedures, recovery at surface Prevention: Battery monitoring, conservative depth-of-discharge limits What can go wrong: Backup power not available, backup power insufficient, recovery procedures not executed correctly.\nCommunication Failures Tether severance (ROV):\nCauses: Snagging, excessive tension, mechanical damage Effect: Complete loss of communication and power Recovery: Vehicle may have emergency systems (acoustic release, buoyancy), surface recovery Prevention: Tether management, tension monitoring, protective routing Acoustic link loss (AUV):\nCauses: Range exceeded, acoustic interference, equipment failure Effect: Loss of real-time communication, vehicle continues mission or enters failsafe Recovery: Vehicle may surface at pre-programmed waypoint, or continue mission autonomously Prevention: Range management, acoustic link monitoring, failsafe programming What can go wrong: Emergency systems not functional, failsafe procedures not executed, vehicle lost.\nSensor Failures Camera failure:\nCauses: Water ingress, electronics failure, mechanical damage Effect: Loss of primary situational awareness Recovery: Continue with remaining cameras, or abort if no backup Prevention: Redundant cameras, watertight housings, pre-dive testing Sonar failure:\nCauses: Transducer failure, electronics failure, acoustic interference Effect: Loss of long-range awareness, navigation capability reduced Recovery: Continue with cameras and other sensors, or abort if navigation critical Prevention: Redundant sonar systems, pre-dive testing INS failure:\nCauses: Sensor failure, calibration drift, initialization error Effect: Loss of precise navigation, position uncertainty increases Recovery: Continue with dead reckoning, or abort if precision required Prevention: Redundant INS systems, regular calibration, initialization checks What can go wrong: Multiple sensor failures, no backup sensors, operations continue beyond safe limits.\nPropulsion Failures Thruster failure:\nCauses: Mechanical failure, electrical failure, entanglement Effect: Reduced maneuverability, inability to maintain position Recovery: Continue with remaining thrusters, or abort if insufficient control Prevention: Redundant thrusters, pre-dive testing, thruster monitoring Thruster entanglement:\nCauses: Debris, fishing line, umbilical contact Effect: Thruster unable to rotate, reduced or asymmetric thrust Recovery: Attempt to clear entanglement, or abort if unable to clear Prevention: Thruster guards, operational awareness, careful maneuvering What can go wrong: Multiple thruster failures, asymmetric failures cause instability, recovery not possible.\nManipulator Failures Manipulator mechanical failure:\nCauses: Overload, mechanical wear, water ingress Effect: Loss of work capability, manipulator may be stuck or uncontrolled Recovery: Abort work tasks, continue inspection if possible Prevention: Load monitoring, regular maintenance, pre-dive testing Tool failure:\nCauses: Tool-specific failures (cutting tool, sampling tool, etc.) Effect: Specific work task cannot be performed Recovery: Switch to backup tool, or abort specific task Prevention: Redundant tools, tool testing, proper tool selection What can go wrong: No backup tools, tool failure causes vehicle damage, mission objectives not achievable.\nRecovery Procedures Emergency Recovery When immediate recovery is required:\nAbort mission — Cease all work tasks, prepare for recovery Assess situation — Determine recovery method based on failure mode Execute recovery — Winch recovery (ROV), surface procedures (AUV), or alternative method Secure vehicle — Once recovered, secure vehicle and assess damage Document incident — Record failure mode, recovery actions, lessons learned Responsibility: Supervisor directs recovery; pilot executes recovery procedures.\nDegraded Operations When operations can continue with limitations:\nAssess capability — Determine remaining operational capability Revise mission — Adjust mission objectives to match capability Increase monitoring — Enhanced monitoring for additional failures Prepare recovery — Ready recovery procedures in case of further degradation Document status — Record degraded status and operational limitations What can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nFailure Prevention Design Principles Redundancy — Critical systems should have backups Monitoring — Systems should monitor their own health Failsafes — Systems should fail to safe states Isolation — Failures should not cascade to other systems Operational reality: Redundancy adds cost and complexity.

They do not adequately address autonomous vehicles, multi-vehicle systems, AI-assisted decision-making, or modern data integrity requirements. This page identifies the most significant gaps.\nWhy This Exists Operating in regulatory grey areas carries risk — legal, safety, and reputational. Identifying gaps explicitly allows operators to develop interim mitigations, engage with standards bodies, and make informed decisions about where to apply conservative interpretations.\nWho This Is For Standards body participants and contributors Regulatory compliance teams identifying risks Engineers designing systems that must operate within (or despite) current frameworks Project managers scoping regulatory engagement for novel operations Gap 1: Autonomous Decision-Making What standards say: Most standards require human decision-making for safety-critical actions. \u0026ldquo;The operator shall ensure…\u0026rdquo; assumes a human is making real-time decisions.\nWhat autonomous systems do: AUVs make decisions — about route, speed, sensor operation, and emergency response — without real-time human input.\nImpact: No standards specify how to validate autonomous decision logic, how to allocate liability for autonomous decisions, or how to certify autonomous safety behaviours.\nInterim approach: Treat autonomous systems as tools that extend human capability; define the operating envelope within which the vehicle may act autonomously; require human authorisation for actions outside that envelope.\nGap 2: Multi-Vehicle Coordination What standards say: Regulations define safety zones and operating envelopes for individual vehicles. Interaction between vehicles is addressed only for collision avoidance at the maritime level.\nWhat swarm systems do: Multiple vehicles operate in close proximity, share information, and make coordinated decisions. The safety of any one vehicle depends on the behaviour of others.\nImpact: No standards address minimum separation requirements for cooperative subsea vehicles, coordination protocol requirements, or how to handle loss of one vehicle in a multi-vehicle mission.\nInterim approach: Define mission-specific rules of encounter; require that each vehicle is safe to operate independently (no safety dependency on peer vehicles); document all coordination assumptions in the mission plan.\nGap 3: Software Verification and Validation What standards say: General safety management frameworks require that equipment is fit for purpose. Software is rarely addressed specifically, beyond requiring testing.\nWhat modern systems require: AUVs and autonomous systems depend on complex software stacks. Failure modes in software are not analogous to hardware failures. Software can fail in emergent, unanticipated ways.\nImpact: No standards specify software development lifecycle requirements, testing coverage expectations, or how to handle software updates to deployed systems.\nInterim approach: Apply aerospace or automotive software standards (DO-178C, ISO 26262) by analogy; maintain software version traceability; require controlled update processes for deployed vehicles.\nGap 4: Data Integrity and Provenance What standards say: Operational records must be maintained. Formats and content are sometimes specified for specific industries (diving logs, survey records).\nWhat modern operations produce: Large volumes of sensor data from multiple systems, processed through complex pipelines, stored in distributed systems. The lineage from raw measurement to delivered data product is rarely documented systematically.\nImpact: Data used for safety decisions, regulatory submissions, and legal proceedings may not be demonstrably reliable. Data integrity cannot be audited retrospectively.\nInterim approach: Implement data provenance tracking as described in Data Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody ; apply audit log requirements from Audit Logs \u0026amp; Immutability .\nGap 5: Communication Loss Handling What standards say: Emergency procedures require that operations can be halted. The implicit assumption is that communication with the operating system is always available.\nWhat autonomous systems experience: Communication loss is an expected operational condition for AUVs operating at range or depth. Autonomous systems must handle communication loss safely without human intervention.\nImpact: No standards specify what behaviour is required of an autonomous system during communication loss, how long a vehicle may operate without communication before mission abort is required, or how communication loss events must be logged.\nInterim approach: Define explicit loss-of-comms behaviours for each mission type; require that vehicles default to a safe state on communication loss; log all communication loss events with duration and vehicle state.\nGap 6: AI and Machine Learning What standards say: Decision systems must be reliable and verifiable. Traditional engineering standards assume deterministic systems.\nWhat ML-based systems do: Learn from data; may behave differently on data outside their training distribution; cannot always explain decisions.\nImpact: No standards address how to validate ML models for safety-critical applications, what training data requirements apply, how to handle model drift, or how to audit ML-based decisions.\nInterim approach: Treat ML as advisory only; require human authorisation for safety-critical actions recommended by ML; maintain training data and model version records; monitor for performance degradation.\nRelated Topics Why Auditability Matters Autonomy Challenges \u0026amp; Legacy Assumptions Open Problems in Subsea Operations Regulatory Landscape Overview ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/open-standards/gaps/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"gaps-in-current-standards\"\u003eGaps in Current Standards\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExisting standards for subsea operations were developed primarily for human divers and remotely operated vehicles with continuous operator oversight.

Position errors of a few metres can place an ROV on the wrong side of a pipeline or mis-identify the location of a discovered anomaly. Understanding and communicating positional uncertainty is essential for anyone using or producing subsea geospatial data.\nWhy This Exists Subsea positioning systems do not have the luxury of GPS, which loses signal underwater. Acoustic positioning systems, inertial navigation units, and Doppler velocity loggers all accumulate error over time and distance. Knowing how much to trust a position — and under what conditions — is as important as knowing the position itself.\nWho This Is For Survey engineers designing positioning systems ROV pilots and AUV operators interpreting positional data Data managers publishing survey products Project engineers using subsea geospatial data for engineering decisions Coordinate Reference Systems Why CRS Matters The same physical point has different numerical coordinates depending on the coordinate reference system (CRS) used. Mixing CRS without transformation causes positional errors that can be tens to hundreds of metres.\nRequired practice: All geospatial data must have an explicitly declared CRS. Datum and projection must be stated, not assumed.\nCommon CRS for Subsea Operations WGS84 — Global datum used by GPS; commonly used for vessel positions ETRS89 — European reference frame; stable relative to the European plate Local projections — UTM zones or project-specific projections for survey products Vertical datums — Depth below mean sea level, chart datum, or ellipsoid height must be stated Datum Shifts Transforming between datums introduces errors. The magnitude of the shift between WGS84 and older national datums can exceed 100m. Any transformation must use appropriate transformation parameters and the resulting uncertainty must be added to the positional uncertainty budget.\nSubsea Positioning Technologies Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) USBL measures the range and bearing from a surface transducer to an underwater transponder:\nAccuracy — Typically 0.5–1% of slant range; degrades with depth and range Errors — Vessel motion, transducer alignment, sound speed profile Mitigation — Gyro-stabilised transducers, accurate sound speed profiling, USBL calibration transponders Long Baseline (LBL) LBL uses an array of seabed transponders to provide positioning independent of vessel motion:\nAccuracy — Typically 0.1–1m RMS in well-surveyed arrays Errors — Transponder position uncertainty, sound speed errors, acoustic multipath Deployment requirement — Transponder array must be surveyed before LBL can be used Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) INS integrates accelerometer and gyroscope data to propagate a position forward from a known starting point:\nAccuracy — Excellent over short periods; error accumulates over time (dead reckoning drift) Aiding — DVL (Doppler velocity log) and periodic USBL/LBL fixes constrain INS drift Reset — Errors must be reset by tying to a known position Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) DVL measures velocity over the seabed using acoustic Doppler:\nAccuracy — Velocity accuracy ~0.1–0.5% of speed; position error accumulates Bottom tracking required — DVL loses bottom-track in steep terrain or beyond range Integration — DVL is essential for INS aiding in subsea operations Uncertainty Quantification Sources of Positional Uncertainty Every position estimate carries contributions from multiple sources:\nSensor measurement uncertainty — Acoustic range/bearing measurement errors Sound speed uncertainty — Incorrect sound speed introduces systematic ranging errors Vessel position uncertainty — GNSS error propagates to seabed positions Time latency — Position timestamps may not align with observation timestamps Processing uncertainty — Filtering, smoothing, and interpolation introduce additional uncertainty Total Propagated Uncertainty (TPU) TPU combines all uncertainty sources into a single position uncertainty estimate, typically expressed as a 2D ellipse at a specified confidence level (e.g., 95%). Modern survey processing software calculates TPU automatically when given correct input uncertainties.\nRequirement: Survey products must include TPU fields or uncertainty layers. Users must not assume position accuracy without checking TPU.\nReporting Position Quality Minimum Requirements for Published Geospatial Data All published geospatial data must include:\nCoordinate reference system (EPSG code or equivalent) Horizontal positional uncertainty (at stated confidence level) Vertical positional uncertainty Positioning system and method used Date and time of position observation (UTC) Quality Flags Position fixes should carry quality flags indicating:\nSource system (USBL, LBL, INS, DVL-only) Data quality at time of observation (signal quality, vessel motion) Whether the position is measured or interpolated Related Topics Data Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody Sensor Calibration Traceability Timestamp Integrity Raw vs Derived Data ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/ocean-data/geospatial/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"geospatial-confidence--uncertainty\"\u003eGeospatial Confidence \u0026amp; Uncertainty\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsea geospatial data — position fixes, survey tracks, sonar maps, pipeline routes — is used for safety-critical decisions.

Supervisors, divers, and managers must understand how human performance degrades under realistic operational conditions.\nWho This Is For Diving supervisors responsible for crew performance Safety officers conducting incident investigations Operations managers designing work schedules Trainers developing dive team competency Fatigue Sources of Fatigue in Diving Thermal stress — Cold water accelerates fatigue; hot water suits add thermal load Physical exertion — Fighting currents, heavy manual tasks, awkward working positions Long duty cycles — Extended standby and preparation time before in-water work Night operations — Disrupted sleep cycles in continuous operations Travel and time zones — Mobilisation to remote locations Fatigue and Performance Fatigued divers exhibit:\nReduced concentration and increased error rates Slower decision-making Increased risk-taking Reduced emergency response capability Operational rule: Fatigue cannot be reliably self-assessed. Supervisors must enforce rest requirements regardless of diver willingness to continue.\nWork-Rest Requirements USN and IMCA guidance requires minimum rest periods between dives and overnight. Dive supervisors must track cumulative work hours and enforce limits.\nCommunication In-Water Communication Failures Voice communications in diving are affected by:\nHelium speech distortion — Heliox mixtures make speech difficult to understand Mask seal and regulator noise — Background noise masks communications Umbilical routing — Long umbilicals introduce electrical noise Task saturation — Divers may not acknowledge comms while focused on tasks Requirement: All in-water communications must be logged. The supervisor must confirm diver acknowledgement before issuing safety-critical instructions.\nSurface Team Communication Between the diving supervisor, crane operator, vessel master, and client:\nEstablish clear authority and communication protocols before diving commences Use standard terminology — avoid ambiguous terms Confirm safety-critical instructions with read-back Task Saturation Divers working on complex tasks can become task-saturated, failing to monitor gas supplies, track bottom time, or respond to surface communications.\nMitigation:\nSupervisor tracks all time and gas metrics from the surface Set explicit reminders for gas checks and ascent times Plan tasks to match cognitive load to conditions Situational Awareness Situational awareness (SA) is the perception and understanding of the current operational state. Loss of SA is a precursor to most serious incidents.\nFactors that degrade SA:\nInformation overload during emergencies Complacency during routine operations Team communication breakdowns Unexpected changes to the dive environment Organisational Pressures Production pressures — vessel day rates, weather windows, client timelines — create incentives to continue diving when conditions warrant a pause or abort.\nSupervisory authority: The diving supervisor has the authority and responsibility to halt diving at any time for safety reasons.

These constraints fundamentally shape how subsea systems can be designed and operated. Understanding them is essential for designing coordination systems that work within physical limits.\nWhy This Exists Systems designed without understanding communication constraints fail in the field. A coordination algorithm that requires 10 round-trip communications per second will not function on an acoustic link that takes 2 seconds for each exchange. Understanding latency and bandwidth drives realistic system design.\nWho This Is For Engineers designing subsea communication systems Architects designing multi-vehicle coordination protocols Operations managers setting realistic expectations for remote monitoring Mission planners designing communication schedules Acoustic Communication Fundamentals Propagation Speed Sound travels at approximately 1500 m/s in seawater (varying with temperature, salinity, and pressure). At 1500m range:\nOne-way latency: ~1 second Round-trip latency: ~2 seconds (minimum, without processing delays) At longer ranges:\n3000m → 2s one-way, 4s round-trip 10km → 6.7s one-way, 13.3s round-trip Implication: Real-time control at range is impossible. Any control loop that relies on acoustic feedback will have response delays measured in seconds to tens of seconds.\nBandwidth Acoustic modems in typical subsea configurations provide:\nShort range (\u0026lt;1km): Up to 50 kbps Medium range (1–5km): 1–10 kbps Long range (\u0026gt;5km): \u0026lt;1 kbps Compare to terrestrial WiFi (\u0026gt;100 Mbps) or satellite (1–100 Mbps): acoustic bandwidth is 3–8 orders of magnitude lower.\nImplication: Video streaming, large file transfers, and any high-volume data exchange are not possible acoustically at operational ranges. Only compact, compressed messages are feasible.\nBandwidth-Latency Product The bandwidth-delay product (BDP) determines the amount of data that can be \u0026ldquo;in flight\u0026rdquo; at any time. With high latency and low bandwidth, windowing protocols become critical, and protocol overhead can dominate useful payload.\nExample: At 1 kbps bandwidth and 4s round-trip time, the BDP is 4000 bits (500 bytes). A 50-byte message header represents 10% protocol overhead.\nEffects on System Design Control Loop Design Control systems must be designed for the available round-trip time:\nClosed-loop control requiring fast feedback cannot run over acoustic links at range Supervisory control with slow feedback (seconds to minutes) is feasible Pre-programmed missions with no feedback loop are the most robust approach For a vehicle at 1km range (2s RTT), any control loop with a bandwidth above 0.25 Hz is limited by communication, not vehicle dynamics.\nState Synchronisation Multi-vehicle systems that share state (position, task assignments, sensor data) must manage state synchronisation with high-latency, low-bandwidth links:\nEvent-driven updates — Send updates only when state changes significantly Dead-reckoning — Interpolate state between updates using physical models Eventual consistency — Accept that different vehicles have temporarily inconsistent views of shared state Conflict resolution — Define clear rules for resolving conflicting state updates when they arrive Message Prioritisation Given limited bandwidth, messages must be prioritised:\nSafety-critical: Abort commands, emergency position reports Navigation-critical: Position fixes, collision avoidance Mission-critical: Task updates, sensor alerts Monitoring: Status, telemetry Housekeeping: Logs, diagnostics Lower-priority messages should be queued and delayed (or dropped) when the channel is congested.\nBandwidth Budgeting Calculating a Communication Budget For each vehicle in a multi-vehicle system:\nIdentify all required messages — What must be exchanged for the mission to succeed? Estimate message sizes — How many bytes per message? Estimate message rates — How often must each message be sent? Calculate total bandwidth — Sum of (size × rate) for all messages Compare to available bandwidth — Must be less than available bandwidth with margin for retransmission Retransmission overhead: Acoustic links have high packet loss rates (10–30% in challenging conditions). ARQ (automatic repeat request) protocols can multiply effective bandwidth requirement by 1.3–2×.\nPer-Vehicle Allocation in Multi-Vehicle Systems Total acoustic bandwidth must be shared among all vehicles. With N vehicles:\nAverage per-vehicle bandwidth ≈ total bandwidth / N Critical vehicles (lead, emergency) may be allocated higher priority Optical Communication Tradeoffs Optical modems provide high bandwidth (100 Mbps+) but only at very short ranges (\u0026lt;100m in clear water, much less in turbid water):\nSuitable for: Docking stations, short-range vehicle-to-vehicle, AUV-to-lander Not suitable for: Long-range coordination, operational-scale multi-vehicle systems The latency of optical links is negligible — light travels 2×10⁸ m/s in water, giving \u0026lt;1 μs RTT at 100m range.\nSatellite and Radio Links (Surface) For vehicles that can surface:\nIridium satellite: Global coverage; ~2.4 kbps data (SBD messages) to 1 Mbps (Iridium NEXT terminals); latency ~1s WiFi/4G/5G: When in range; latency \u0026lt;100ms; bandwidth 1–1000 Mbps VHF/UHF radio: Short range (line-of-sight); low bandwidth; negligible latency Surfacing to communicate (scheduled or triggered) is a valid design pattern for AUVs when acoustic bandwidth is insufficient.\nRelated Topics Communication Systems Multi-Vehicle Coordination Loss-of-Comms Behavior Graceful Degradation Control Frameworks ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/swarm-systems/latency-bandwidth/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"latency--bandwidth-tradeoffs\"\u003eLatency \u0026amp; Bandwidth Tradeoffs\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsea communication is constrained by physics: acoustic waves travel at ~1500 m/s through water, and the available bandwidth for acoustic modems is severely limited compared to terrestrial or satellite links.

Procedure update if LOC was caused by a systematic issue Testing LOC Behavior LOC behavior that has never been tested is not LOC behavior — it is untested software that may or may not work when needed.\nRequired testing:\nBench test: simulate communication loss and verify state machine transitions Pool test: verify LOC behavior in a controlled environment Field test (shallow): verify LOC behavior in realistic acoustic conditions before deep deployment Test each scenario: Complete communication loss, gradual degradation, intermittent communication, communication loss during intervention tasks.\nRelated Topics Communication Systems Multi-Vehicle Coordination Latency \u0026amp; Bandwidth Tradeoffs Graceful Degradation Failure Modes \u0026amp; Recovery Autonomy Challenges \u0026amp; Legacy Assumptions ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/swarm-systems/loss-of-comms/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"loss-of-comms-behavior\"\u003eLoss-of-Comms Behavior\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss of communication between a subsea vehicle and its operators is not an edge case — it is an expected operational condition.

This requires a reliable communication link, which is not guaranteed for acoustic modems at range.\nCommunication in Multi-Vehicle Systems Bandwidth Limitations Acoustic modems typically provide \u0026lt;10 kbps total bandwidth for a network of vehicles. With multiple vehicles sharing a channel:\nEach vehicle gets a fraction of total bandwidth Message collision must be managed (time-division or CDMA) High-rate data cannot be shared in real time Communication Protocols Multi-vehicle systems use protocols to manage shared communication channels:\nTime-division multiple access (TDMA) — Each vehicle has a time slot to transmit; predictable but wastes capacity when vehicles have nothing to say CSMA — Vehicles listen before transmitting; efficient but collision-prone in high-traffic conditions OFDM — Orthogonal frequency division; higher bandwidth but complex Minimum Required Communication A well-designed multi-vehicle system should function safely even with only a fraction of planned communications succeeding. Safety-critical coordination (collision avoidance, abort commands) must use the most reliable communication mode available.\nSafety Separation Standards No universal standard exists for minimum separation between subsea vehicles.

USBL accuracy degrades with depth. INS/DVL systems accumulate error over time. GPS is unavailable underwater.\nCurrent State Best available solutions combine INS + DVL + periodic USBL aiding, achieving decimetre accuracy over kilometre-scale missions in good conditions. In challenging terrain or poor acoustic conditions, errors can be metres to tens of metres.\nWhy It Matters AUVs operating in unmapped terrain cannot verify their own position Autonomous collision avoidance requires reliable position knowledge Survey data attributed to incorrect positions is misleading Active Research Directions Terrain-relative navigation using sonar maps Cooperative navigation between multiple vehicles Improved acoustic methods for longer range/depth Long-Duration Energy Storage The Problem Underwater vehicles are energy-limited. Batteries have fixed capacity, and recharging requires surfacing or docking. Long-duration autonomous operations (days to weeks) require either very large batteries, slow speeds, or underwater recharging.\nCurrent State Lithium-based batteries provide energy density of ~200 Wh/kg. Fuel cells offer higher density but add complexity and hydrogen storage challenges. Underwater recharging works for vehicles that can return to a dock, but remains unreliable for extended range operations.\nWhy It Matters Mission duration limits what can be monitored or inspected autonomously Return-to-dock requirements constrain operational area Energy availability affects emergency response capability (a vehicle that cannot abort safely is a hazard) Reliable Subsea Communication The Problem Acoustic communication provides the only long-range data link for subsea vehicles, but bandwidth is severely limited (typically \u0026lt;10 kbps) and latency is high (seconds per exchange). Optical communication provides high bandwidth but over very short ranges (\u0026lt;100m in clear water).\nCurrent State No technology provides both long-range and high-bandwidth subsea communication. Operations requiring rich real-time data exchange must use short umbilicals or accept very low data rates.\nWhy It Matters Autonomous vehicles that cannot communicate cannot receive updated mission plans or abort commands Real-time monitoring of complex situations requires data rates that acoustic links cannot provide Swarm coordination at range is limited by available communication bandwidth Fault Tolerance in Autonomous Decisions The Problem How should an autonomous vehicle behave when it encounters a situation outside its design envelope? Sensors may fail partially (giving wrong data rather than no data). Environmental conditions may be outside tested ranges. Multiple faults may interact unexpectedly.\nCurrent State Most autonomous systems handle individual, anticipated faults. Combinations of faults, especially those involving sensor data that is wrong rather than missing, are much harder. There is no general solution for safe behaviour under arbitrary fault combinations.\nWhy It Matters Vehicles that behave dangerously under unexpected faults cannot be safely deployed in complex environments Regulatory certification of autonomous safety behaviours requires confidence in fault response Incident investigation requires understanding what the system \u0026ldquo;thought\u0026rdquo; it was doing Standardised Autonomy Certification The Problem There is no accepted standard for certifying that an autonomous subsea system is safe to operate. Aviation (DO-178C for software, DO-254 for hardware) and automotive (ISO 26262) have developed rigorous frameworks over decades. Subsea autonomy has none.\nCurrent State Certifiers apply analogous standards by judgement. Different jurisdictions require different approaches. Novel systems face multi-year regulatory uncertainty.\nWhy It Matters Operators cannot demonstrate regulatory compliance for autonomous deployments Liability is unclear when an autonomous system causes harm Innovation is slowed by regulatory uncertainty Subsea Environmental Interaction Prediction The Problem Predicting how a vehicle will interact with the environment — particularly in near-seabed operations, strong currents, and turbid water — is difficult. Vehicle dynamics models built in controlled conditions do not always transfer to field conditions.\nWhy It Matters Collision avoidance near seabed structures requires accurate motion prediction Safe operation near sensitive environmental sites requires knowing the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s footprint Survey quality depends on maintaining accurate track spacing Related Topics Gaps in Current Standards Autonomy Challenges \u0026amp; Legacy Assumptions Why Auditability Matters Loss-of-Comms Behavior Communication Systems ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/open-standards/open-problems/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-problems-in-subsea-operations\"\u003eOpen Problems in Subsea Operations\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome challenges in subsea operations remain genuinely unsolved — not merely neglected, but actively difficult despite significant research and engineering effort.

A very unlikely event with catastrophic consequences may warrant more attention than a frequent event with minor consequences, depending on organisational risk tolerances.\nRisk Matrices A risk matrix categorises risks by likelihood and consequence into risk bands:\nLikelihood scale (example):\n5 — Frequent: Expected to occur more than once per year 4 — Probable: Expected to occur once per year 3 — Occasional: May occur once per 10 years 2 — Remote: May occur once per 100 years 1 — Improbable: Unlikely to occur in system lifetime Consequence scale (example):\n5 — Catastrophic: Multiple fatalities 4 — Critical: Single fatality or permanent disability 3 — Marginal: Lost-time injury; significant environmental damage 2 — Negligible: Minor injury; minor environmental effect 1 — Minimal: No injury; no environmental effect Risk band = Likelihood rating × Consequence rating\nThe risk band determines acceptability and required response.\nQualitative vs Quantitative Risk Assessment Qualitative Risk Assessment (QRA-L) Uses the risk matrix with expert judgement for likelihood and consequence ratings:\nFaster and less resource-intensive — Suitable for most operational decisions Dependent on expert judgement — Results reflect team experience and bias Limited comparability — Different teams may rate the same risk differently Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) Uses historical data, fault trees, and event trees to calculate numerical risk estimates:\nProvides numerical risk estimates (e.g., 1×10⁻⁴ fatalities per year) Enables comparison against numerical risk criteria (e.g., individual risk criteria) Resource-intensive — Requires significant data and expertise Appropriate for complex, high-consequence operations — Major facilities, novel systems Common Risk Models for Subsea Operations Bow-Tie Analysis Bow-tie diagrams link a central hazardous event (the \u0026ldquo;top event\u0026rdquo;) to its causes (threats) on the left and consequences on the right. Barriers are identified on each side:\nPrevention barriers — Prevent threats from causing the top event Recovery barriers — Limit consequences after the top event occurs Bow-ties are particularly useful for diving and subsea operations because they visualise the entire risk pathway clearly and support ALARP demonstration.\nFault Tree Analysis (FTA) FTA identifies combinations of failures that lead to an undesired top event:\nTop-down analysis — Start with the top event and work down to causes Logic gates — AND gates (all inputs required) and OR gates (any input sufficient) Minimum cut sets — Smallest combinations of failures that cause the top event Useful for: Complex systems with multiple independent failure modes Event Tree Analysis (ETA) ETA traces sequences of events from an initiating event to final outcomes:\nForward analysis — Start with the initiating event and trace forward Branch points — At each branch, success or failure of a safeguard is considered Outcome probabilities — Combined with FTA results to estimate consequence likelihood Individual Risk and Societal Risk Individual Risk The probability that a specific individual in a defined role or location will die due to the operation per year:\nTypical criterion for workers: \u0026lt;1×10⁻³ per year (broadly acceptable); intolerable above 1×10⁻² per year HSE guidance (UK): Maximum tolerable individual risk for workers is 1×10⁻³ per year Societal Risk (F-N Curves) Societal risk considers the risk to the public or workforce as a whole, accounting for both frequency and number of fatalities. Plotted as F-N curves (frequency vs. number of fatalities), these are compared against regulatory criteria lines.\nResidual Risk and ALARP Risk models quantify risk both before and after controls are applied.

This provides:\nReal control system behaviour — Exactly the same response characteristics as the real vehicle Real failure modes — Hardware failures manifest as they do in deployment Software validation — Control software can be tested without deploying the vehicle Cost: HIL requires procuring additional hardware and integrating it with the simulation environment.

Rehearsal must account for this:\nIdentify the assumptions in the site model Rehearse what happens when those assumptions are wrong \u0026ldquo;What if the structure is further north than the chart shows?\u0026rdquo; The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to prepare operators to handle it.\nRehearsal for Diving Operations Pre-dive briefings are a form of rehearsal:\nWalk through the dive plan step by step Identify each diver\u0026rsquo;s tasks and the sequence Confirm communication procedures Confirm gas management plan (turning points, ascent triggers) Walk through emergency procedures Documented requirement: Many regulations require a documented pre-dive briefing. The briefing record serves as evidence that the team was prepared.\nDive Simulation Tools For complex dives, dedicated dive simulation software can model:\nDecompression profiles for the planned dive and alternatives Gas consumption under different work rates Ascent profiles for different emergency scenarios Recording and Debrief During Rehearsal Record:\nThe rehearsal run (video capture of the simulation) Deviations from plan Problems identified Questions raised by the team After Rehearsal Debrief:\nWhat problems were identified? What changes are required to the plan? Were all emergency responses adequate? Does the team have a shared understanding of the mission? Output: Updated mission plan with issues resolved; list of open questions requiring follow-up before the mission.\nRelated Topics Why Simulation Matters Digital Twins Physics vs Control Realism Confidence Calibration Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/simulation-training/rehearsal/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"pre-mission-rehearsal\"\u003ePre-Mission Rehearsal\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePre-mission rehearsal uses simulation to walk through a planned mission before it occurs.

Protocols for emergency vessel movement with divers deployed must be agreed and briefed before diving.\nClient / Principal The client commissions the diving operation and is responsible for:\nProviding accurate information about the work site (existing infrastructure, hazards, access) Defining the work scope clearly Not pressuring the diving contractor to proceed unsafely Ensuring their own personnel do not create hazards for the diving operation Limitation: Clients cannot direct diving operations. The diving contractor retains operational control.\nEquipment Manufacturer / Supplier Manufacturers are responsible for:\nEquipment performing to specification under stated operating conditions Providing adequate documentation and training materials Communicating known defects or limitations promptly Supporting incident investigation when equipment failure may be involved Responsibility Allocation in Contracts What Must Be in the Contract Diving services contracts must specify:\nWhich party provides each category of equipment Which party is responsible for equipment inspection and maintenance The diving contractor\u0026rsquo;s exclusive operational authority Insurance requirements for each party Incident reporting and investigation obligations What constitutes a safe/unsafe worksite and who makes that determination Indemnities and Liability Caps Contracts typically allocate liability through mutual indemnities — each party takes responsibility for loss to its own personnel and property. Liability caps limit exposure for consequential losses.\nWarning: Indemnity structures that shift safety liability to the diving contractor for client-caused conditions (inadequate site information, client-created hazards) create perverse incentives. Contracts should allocate liability to the party in control of the risk.\nResponsibility in Multi-Contractor Operations Complex offshore operations may involve multiple contractors operating simultaneously.

Divers saturate their tissues with breathing gas at the working depth and remain at that pressure for days or weeks, decompressing only once at the end of the dive system.\nWhy This Exists Saturation diving is the only practical method for prolonged work at depths beyond 50m (165 ft). Without it, surface-supplied divers would spend more time in decompression than on the work site. Understanding saturation systems is essential for planning deep inspection, installation, and repair work.\nWho This Is For Saturation diving supervisors and system operators Offshore installation managers overseeing deep work Engineers specifying diving systems for deep projects Safety officers reviewing saturation diving plans How Saturation Diving Works The Saturation Principle Once a diver\u0026rsquo;s tissues are fully saturated with inert gas at a given pressure, the decompression obligation does not increase with additional bottom time. This allows divers to remain at depth for days or weeks with only a single decompression at the end of the saturation period.\nKey advantage: A diver working at 150m for 30 days faces the same decompression obligation as one working there for 1 day.\nSystem Components A saturation diving system consists of:\nLiving chambers — Pressurized habitat where divers sleep, eat, and rest between bell runs Transfer lock — Connects living chambers to the diving bell at pressure Diving bell — Closed bell that transports divers from the living chamber to depth and back Life support control — Monitors and controls gas mixture, temperature, and CO₂ scrubbing Deck decompression chambers (DDC) — The main pressure vessel on deck Umbilicals — Hot water, communications, and breathing gas supply from the bell to the diver Gas Mixtures Saturation diving uses heliox (helium/oxygen) breathing mixtures:\nHelium replaces nitrogen to eliminate nitrogen narcosis and reduce decompression time Oxygen partial pressure is maintained at 0.4–0.5 bar to prevent oxygen toxicity while ensuring adequate oxygen delivery Depth-specific mixtures are calculated for each operation to maintain safe gas partial pressures Operational Procedures Bell Run Cycle A typical bell run involves:\nDivers transfer from living chamber through the transfer lock into the bell Bell is sealed and lowered to the working depth Bell hatch is opened; divers exit on umbilicals to perform work Divers return to the bell after the planned work period Bell hatch is closed and bell ascends to the deck Bell locks onto the living system and divers transfer back Work period limits: Diver excursion time is limited by CO₂ scrubber capacity, thermal protection, and fatigue.\nSaturation Decompression Decompression from saturation follows a slow, controlled ascent:\nRate — Typically 1.8m (6 ft) per hour, slowing at shallower depths Duration — A saturation at 100m requires approximately 60 hours of decompression Stops — Decompression may include stops at prescribed depths Monitoring — Divers are monitored continuously for signs of decompression sickness Depth Limits and Pressure Considerations Operational Depth Limits Air diving — Not suitable for saturation (narcosis, oxygen toxicity) Heliox saturation — Routinely to 300m, experimentally to 600m+ High-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) — A compression-related condition limiting very deep saturation HPNS At very high pressures, divers may experience tremors, cognitive impairment, and EEG changes. This limits the rate of compression and the practical depth ceiling for saturation diving.\nSafety Considerations System Integrity Saturation divers are entirely dependent on the system maintaining pressure. Any pressure loss is immediately life-threatening. Key safety requirements:\nRedundant gas supplies Backup life support systems Emergency breathing systems inside chambers Trained standby diver ready for emergency bell recovery Medical Support A diving medical officer must be available throughout saturation operations. Medical emergencies inside the system require treatment under pressure or controlled recompression followed by decompression — both complex procedures.\nRelated Topics Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment USN Dive Tables Decompression Theory (Operational) Emergency Response Frameworks ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/commercial-diving/saturation-overview/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"saturation-diving-overview\"\u003eSaturation Diving Overview\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturation diving allows divers to live and work at pressure for extended periods, eliminating repeated compression and decompression cycles.

All traceable calibrations ultimately link back to these standards.\nWorking Standards and Reference Instruments Below NMI standards:\nReference standards — Calibrated directly against NMI standards; used in calibration laboratories Working standards — Calibrated against reference standards; used for field instrument calibration Field instruments — Calibrated against working standards before deployment Each comparison in this chain must be documented with calibration certificates and uncertainty estimates.\nCalibration Documentation Requirements A valid calibration record must include:\nInstrument identifier — Serial number, asset tag Calibration date — Date calibration was performed Calibration laboratory — Name and accreditation status of the performing laboratory Standards used — Identification and certificate numbers of reference standards Measurement results — As-found and as-left readings at each calibration point Uncertainty — Measurement uncertainty at each calibration point (k=2, 95% confidence) Pass/fail determination — Whether the instrument meets its specification Next calibration due — Date or interval for next calibration Technician signature — Identity of the person performing the calibration Calibration Intervals Calibration intervals balance cost against the risk of operating with out-of-specification sensors:\nHigh-risk sensors — Shorter intervals (e.g., pressure sensors used for dive safety calculations) Stable, low-risk sensors — Longer intervals based on historical stability data Event-triggered recalibration — After physical shock, repair, unusual readings, or suspected damage Operational rule: Instruments used beyond their calibration due date should be flagged and their data marked as potentially invalid until recalibration is completed.\nCommon Subsea Sensor Types Pressure/Depth Sensors Criticality: High — used for dive depth monitoring, decompression calculations Calibration requirements: Traceable to primary pressure standards; calibrate at multiple points across the operating range Common issues: Zero drift, span drift after exposure to pressure cycling CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth) Sensors Criticality: High for oceanographic data quality Calibration requirements: Temperature traceable to ITS-90; conductivity calibrated against standard seawater; pressure as above Common issues: Conductivity cell fouling, thermal lag Acoustic Sensors (USBL, DVL, ADCP) Criticality: Medium to high depending on application Calibration requirements: Sound speed corrections; alignment surveys for USBL Common issues: Sound speed profile errors, transducer fouling Dissolved Oxygen Sensors Criticality: Medium for environmental monitoring Calibration requirements: Two-point calibration (zero and saturated); temperature compensation Common issues: Membrane fouling, electrolyte depletion Measurement Uncertainty Every measurement has uncertainty — a range within which the true value lies with specified probability. Uncertainty must be:\nQuantified — Not just \u0026ldquo;we calibrated it\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;uncertainty is ±0.1°C at k=2\u0026rdquo; Propagated — When measurements are combined or processed, uncertainties combine Reported — Data products must include uncertainty estimates Ignoring uncertainty leads to false confidence in data quality.

Payload selection drives mission capability, power consumption, data volume, and vehicle configuration. Understanding sensor types, their capabilities, and their limitations is essential for mission planning and data quality assessment.\nWhy This Exists Sensors are how subsea vehicles perceive and record their environment. The right sensor for a job depends on the target, the environment, the required resolution and accuracy, and the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s power and space budget.

This page covers the equipment, procedures, and operational considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Surface-supplied diving provides continuous gas supply, real-time communication, and direct surface supervision. Unlike scuba, the diver remains connected to the surface, enabling longer bottom times, better safety oversight, and support for complex work tasks.\nWho This Is For Commercial divers working surface-supplied Dive supervisors planning and overseeing operations Tenders and support personnel Safety officers reviewing procedures Auditors assessing operational compliance System Components Gas Supply System The surface gas supply provides breathing gas to the diver through an umbilical. In practice, this means:\nPrimary gas supply — Typically air or nitrox for shallow work, helium-oxygen (heliox) or trimix for deeper operations Backup gas supply — Independent secondary system with sufficient capacity for emergency ascent Gas quality monitoring — Continuous analysis of oxygen content, contaminants, and pressure Emergency gas — Bailout cylinder carried by diver for emergency ascent What can go wrong: Gas supply failure, contamination, incorrect gas mix, umbilical damage. Each failure mode requires specific response procedures documented in dive plans.\nDiving Umbilical The umbilical carries gas, communication, and sometimes power to the diver. Operational considerations:\nGas hose — Primary breathing gas supply, typically 3/8\u0026quot; to 1/2\u0026quot; ID Communication cable — Hard-wired or fiber-optic voice communication Hot water hose — For thermal protection in cold water (if applicable) Strength member — Steel wire or Kevlar strength member for load handling Umbilical management — Tending, deployment, and recovery procedures What can go wrong: Umbilical entanglement, damage from sharp edges, communication loss, gas supply interruption. Umbilical management is a critical operational skill.\nDiving Helmet or Full-Face Mask The diver\u0026rsquo;s interface with the surface-supplied system:\nHelmet systems — Hard hat with integrated communication, gas supply, and exhaust Full-face mask systems — Lighter weight alternative with similar functionality Communication — Hard-wired voice communication with surface Gas flow — Demand valve or free-flow system depending on design What can go wrong: Communication failure, mask flooding, gas flow interruption, vision obstruction. Divers must be trained in emergency procedures for each failure mode.\nDiver Monitoring Surface personnel monitor diver status through:\nVoice communication — Continuous or periodic check-ins Depth monitoring — Depth gauge or transducer on surface Gas consumption — Flow meters and pressure monitoring Visual observation — When visibility permits, direct observation from surface What can go wrong: Communication loss, depth monitoring failure, missed check-ins. Supervisors must have clear procedures for handling loss of communication.\nOperational Procedures Pre-Dive Checks Before each dive, verify:\nGas supply — Primary and backup systems operational, correct gas mix, sufficient volume Umbilical — No damage, proper routing, adequate length for planned work Communication — Two-way communication functional, backup communication available Diver equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment checked Surface support — Tender, supervisor, standby diver, emergency equipment ready Responsibility: Dive supervisor verifies surface systems; diver verifies personal equipment. Both must confirm before dive commences.\nDuring Dive Operations Standard operational practices:\nCheck-in procedures — Regular voice check-ins at specified intervals Depth/time tracking — Continuous monitoring of depth and bottom time Gas management — Monitoring consumption and remaining supply Work task execution — Following planned work procedures Umbilical management — Maintaining proper umbilical routing and avoiding entanglement What can go wrong: Task fixation leading to missed check-ins, umbilical entanglement, gas consumption exceeding plan, communication degradation. Supervisors must maintain situational awareness and intervene when necessary.\nPost-Dive Procedures After dive completion:\nEquipment recovery — Safe recovery of diver and umbilical Equipment inspection — Post-dive inspection for damage or wear Debrief — Discussion of dive execution, issues encountered, lessons learned Documentation — Recording dive details in dive log Responsibility: Supervisor ensures proper recovery and documentation; diver reports any issues or anomalies.\nFailure Modes \u0026amp; Response Communication Loss What happens: Diver cannot communicate with surface, or surface cannot hear diver.\nResponse framework:\nSurface attempts to re-establish communication If no response, initiate emergency procedures Standby diver may be deployed to locate and assist Emergency ascent procedures activated if necessary Responsibility: Supervisor initiates response; standby diver executes if deployed.\nGas Supply Failure What happens: Primary gas supply interrupted or contaminated.\nResponse framework:\nDiver switches to bailout cylinder Surface attempts to restore primary supply If restoration fails, initiate emergency ascent Standby diver may be deployed to assist Responsibility: Diver executes immediate bailout; surface supports recovery.\nUmbilical Entanglement What happens: Umbilical becomes entangled in structure or equipment.\nResponse framework:\nDiver attempts to clear entanglement Surface provides guidance and support If unable to clear, standby diver may be deployed Emergency procedures activated if diver cannot be freed Responsibility: Diver attempts self-rescue first; surface coordinates response.\nOperational Limits Surface-supplied diving has practical limits:\nDepth limits — Typically 50-60m on air, deeper with mixed gas (subject to gas mix and decompression requirements) Bottom time — Limited by decompression requirements and gas supply Work complexity — Constrained by umbilical management and communication requirements Environmental conditions — Current, visibility, and sea state affect operational feasibility What can go wrong: Operations planned beyond practical limits, environmental conditions worse than anticipated, equipment limitations not recognized. Dive planning must account for these limits.\nData \u0026amp; Records Surface-supplied diving operations generate records:\nDive logs — Depth, time, gas consumption, work performed Communication records — Voice logs (if recorded) Equipment records — Maintenance, inspection, and failure records Incident reports — Documentation of anomalies, near-misses, or incidents Audit-worthiness: Records must be traceable, timestamped, and suitable for regulatory review.

Table 9-6 may only be used when the maximum altitude achieved is 10,000 feet or less. For ascents above 10,000 feet, consult NAVSEA 00C for guidance. The cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is maintained at a constant value regardless of the actual altitude of the flight. Though cabin pressure varies somewhat with aircraft type, the nominal value is 8,000 feet. For commercial flights, use a final altitude of 8,000 feet to compute the required surface interval before flying. No surface interval is required before taking a commercial flight if the dive site is at 8,000 feet or higher. In this case, flying results in an increase in atmospheric pressure rather than a decrease. For ascent to altitude following a non-saturation helium-oxygen dive, wait 12 hours if the dive was a no-decompression dive. Wait 24 hours if the dive was a decompression dive. Table 9-7.

Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 60 FSW on air is 63 minutes (Group A diver). With residual nitrogen from previous dives, use Table 9-8 to calculate adjusted bottom time.\nWhat is the no-decompression limit at 100 feet? Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 100 FSW on air is 25 minutes (Group A diver). Decompression stops are required beyond this time.\nHow do I calculate a repetitive dive? Find your post-dive repetitive group from Table 9-7 (depth + bottom time) Use Table 9-8 Part 1 (previous group + surface interval) → new group Use Table 9-8 Part 2 (new group + next dive depth) → Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT) Add RNT to planned bottom time → Equivalent Single Dive Time (ESDT) If ESDT \u0026gt; NDL, use Table 9-9 for decompression schedule Use the interactive tool above to perform steps 1–4 automatically.\nWhat is the source of these tables?

Always cross-reference with the official publication.\nThis section provides the complete U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 decompression tables for operational reference. These tables are the authoritative standard for U.S. Navy diving operations and are widely used in commercial diving operations worldwide.\nWhy This Exists The U.S. Navy dive tables are the foundation of decompression planning for air and mixed-gas diving operations. They provide:\nNo-decompression limits — Maximum bottom times at various depths without required decompression stops Decompression schedules — Required stops, times, and gas switches for decompression dives Repetitive dive procedures — Surface interval credits and residual nitrogen/helium times Altitude considerations — Procedures for diving at altitude or ascending to altitude after diving Mixed gas procedures — Helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression tables for deeper operations Operational reality: These tables are used by dive supervisors, commercial divers, and operational personnel worldwide. They must be used correctly and verified against the original publication.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning and overseeing diving operations Commercial divers executing dives requiring decompression Safety officers reviewing dive plans and procedures Training personnel teaching decompression procedures Operational planners developing dive procedures and standards Critical Safety Requirements Before using these tables operationally:\nVerify against original publication — Cross-reference all values with the official NAVSEA publication (SS521-AG-PRO-010) Proper training required — Users must be trained in decompression table procedures Medical clearance — Divers must be medically cleared for diving operations Equipment verification — All diving equipment must be verified and functional Supervisor oversight — All decompression dives require qualified supervisor oversight What can go wrong: Incorrect table use, transcription errors, missing updates, improper application. Each failure mode can result in decompression sickness, injury, or death.\nTable Categories USN Air Dive Tables Complete air decompression tables including an interactive NDL lookup tool:\nTable 9-5 — Repetitive Groups Associated with Initial Ascent to Altitude Table 9-6 — Required Surface Interval Before Ascent to Altitude After Diving Table 9-7 — No-Decompression Limits and Repetitive Group Designators (10–190 FSW) Table 9-8 — Residual Nitrogen Time Table for Repetitive Air Dives Table 9-9 — Air Decompression Table (descent 75 FPM, ascent 30 FPM) The air tables page includes an interactive lookup tool for Tables 9-7 and 9-8 — enter depth and bottom time to instantly determine NDL status, repetitive group, and residual nitrogen time for repetitive dives.\nUSN Helium-Oxygen Dive Tables Complete helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression tables including:\nTable 12-4 — Surface-Supplied HeO2 Decompression Table (60–380+ FSW) Descent rate: 75 FPM | Ascent rate: 30 FPM Mandatory gas switches: HeO2 bottom mix → 50% O2 at 40 FSW → 100% O2 at 30 and 20 FSW MK 16 MOD 1 UBA tables — Closed-circuit rebreather procedures for various oxygen partial pressures Mixed gas procedures — Gas switching procedures and chamber oxygen requirements Source Information Official Source: SS521-AG-PRO-010, U.S. Navy Diving Manual, Revision 7, 01 December 2016 Publisher: Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Publication Authority: Published by Direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command\nOperational Use Before operational use:\nObtain official publication — Secure the official NAVSEA publication Verify all values — Cross-check all table values against the official publication Training verification — Ensure all personnel are properly trained Medical clearance — Verify all divers are medically cleared Equipment check — Verify all equipment is functional and calibrated Supervisor approval — Obtain qualified supervisor approval for all dives Responsibility: The dive supervisor is responsible for ensuring correct table use. Incorrect application can result in serious injury or death.\nFrequently Asked Questions What are the U.S. Navy dive tables used for? The USN dive tables are the primary reference for decompression planning in air and mixed-gas diving. They determine the maximum no-decompression bottom time at any depth, the repetitive group accumulated after surfacing, the required surface interval before a second dive, the residual nitrogen time to add to a repetitive dive, and the full decompression schedule (stops, times, gas) when decompression is required.\nWhat edition is current? Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016) is the current edition. Always confirm you are using Revision 7 and obtain the official NAVSEA publication before operational use.\nWhere is the interactive lookup tool? The USN Air Dive Tables page includes a JavaScript-powered NDL lookup tool for Tables 9-7 and 9-8. Enter depth and bottom time for instant NDL and repetitive group lookup, and enter your surface interval for repetitive dive RNT calculations.\nRelated Topics Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Emergency Response Frameworks Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/commercial-diving/usn-dive-tables/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"usn-dive-tables\"\u003eUSN Dive Tables\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCRITICAL WARNING:\u003c/strong\u003e These tables are transcribed from the official U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016). \u003cstrong\u003eThey must be verified against the original NAVSEA publication before operational use.\u003c/strong\u003e Transcription errors, however unlikely, could be fatal.

Add the RHT to the planned bottom time of the repetitive dive to obtain the equivalent single dive time for decompression planning.\nDepth (fsw) Z O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A 10 \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; 15 \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; \u0026ndash; 20 ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** 269 129 25 ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** 425 279 201 147 106 73 45 30 + + + + 515 361 281 227 186 152 124 100 79 60 43 28 35 420 338 283 241 207 179 155 133 114 97 82 68 54 42 31 20 40 ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** 240 120 50 + + + + 474 345 272 220 181 149 122 98 78 59 42 27 60 217 194 173 154 137 122 108 95 83 71 61 51 41 32 24 16 70 122 112 102 93 85 77 69 61 54 47 41 34 28 22 17 11 80 86 80 73 68 62 56 51 46 40 36 31 26 22 17 13 9 90 67 62 57 53 49 44 40 36 32 29 25 21 17 14 10 7 100 55 51 47 44 40 37 33 30 27 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 110 46 43 40 37 34 31 29 26 23 20 18 15 13 10 8 5 120 40 37 35 32 30 27 25 23 20 18 16 13 11 9 7 5 130 35 33 31 29 27 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 140 32 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 13 11 9 7 6 4 150 29 27 25 23 22 20 18 17 15 13 12 10 8 7 5 4 160 26 25 23 21 20 18 17 15 14 12 11 9 8 6 5 3 170 24 23 21 20 18 17 15 14 13 11 10 8 7 6 4 3 180 22 21 20 18 17 16 14 13 12 10 9 8 7 5 4 3 190 21 20 18 17 16 15 13 12 11 10 9 7 6 5 4 3 200 20 18 17 16 15 14 13 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 Table Notes \u0026ndash; Repetitive dives to these depths are equivalent to remaining on the surface.

Air causes nitrogen narcosis at depths beyond ~100 FSW (individual variation), which impairs diver judgment and performance. Helium does not cause narcosis, making HeO2 the preferred gas for deep operations. HeO2 also has faster decompression kinetics than air at equivalent depths due to helium\u0026rsquo;s lower solubility.\nWhat are the gas switch requirements? USN Table 12-4 mandates specific gas switches during ascent:\nBottom mix (HeO2) — all bottom time and stops at 50 FSW and deeper 50% O2 — stop at 40 FSW 100% O2 — stops at 30 and 20 FSW These switches are non-optional and dramatically reduce total decompression time.\nWhat does \u0026ldquo;Chamber O2 Periods\u0026rdquo; mean? Each chamber O2 period is 30 minutes of 100% oxygen breathing in a deck recompression chamber (DRC) after surfacing. This surface decompression (SurDO2) completes the decompression obligation started in the water. The number of periods required increases with bottom time and depth.\nRelated Topics USN Air Dive Tables — Air decompression tables with interactive NDL lookup USN Dive Tables Overview — Complete index of all USN tables Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment Emergency Response Frameworks ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/commercial-diving/usn-heo2-dive-tables/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"us-navy-diving-manual--revision-7-heo2-and-mixed-gas-dive-tables\"\u003eU.S. Navy Diving Manual — Revision 7 HeO2 and Mixed Gas Dive Tables\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSource:\u003c/strong\u003e SS521-AG-PRO-010, U.S. Navy Diving Manual, Revision 7, 01 December 2016\n\u003cstrong\u003eNAVSEA Reference:\u003c/strong\u003e Published by Direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCRITICAL WARNING:\u003c/strong\u003e These tables are transcribed from the official USN Diving Manual Revision 7. \u003cstrong\u003eThey must be verified against the original publication before operational use.\u003c/strong\u003e Transcription errors, however unlikely, could be fatal.

This page explains why auditability is the critical requirement for trusted autonomous operations.\nWhy This Exists Autonomous systems can operate without human oversight, but this creates a trust problem. How do we know what the system did? Why did it make certain decisions? What went wrong when something fails? Auditability answers these questions and enables trust in autonomous systems.\nWho This Is For System architects designing autonomous systems Regulators reviewing autonomous operations Operators deploying autonomous systems Auditors verifying autonomous operations Incident investigators reconstructing autonomous system behavior The Autonomy-Auditability Tradeoff Raw Autonomy Raw autonomy focuses on:\nCapability — What can the system do? Performance — How well does it perform? Independence — How independently can it operate? Operational reality: Raw autonomy is necessary but not sufficient. A system that can operate autonomously but cannot be audited is not trustworthy.\nAuditability Auditability focuses on:\nObservability — Can we observe what the system is doing? Explainability — Can we explain why the system made decisions? Traceability — Can we trace system behavior to causes? Verifiability — Can we verify system behavior after the fact? Operational reality: Auditability enables trust. Without auditability, autonomous systems cannot be trusted for critical operations.\nWhy Auditability Matters Regulatory Compliance Regulators require auditability:\nIncident investigation — Regulators must be able to investigate incidents Compliance verification — Regulators must be able to verify compliance Accountability — Someone must be accountable for autonomous system behavior Legal requirement: Autonomous systems must be auditable for regulatory compliance. Non-auditable systems may not be permitted.\nInsurance Underwriting Insurers require auditability:\nRisk assessment — Insurers must assess risk of autonomous operations Claims investigation — Insurers must investigate claims Loss prevention — Insurers must understand what went wrong Operational reality: Insurers may not cover non-auditable autonomous systems, or may charge higher premiums.\nIncident Investigation Incident investigation requires auditability:\nWhat happened — Investigators must understand what happened Why it happened — Investigators must understand why it happened How to prevent — Investigators must understand how to prevent recurrence What can go wrong: Non-auditable systems make incident investigation impossible. This creates legal and operational risk.\nOperational Trust Operators require auditability:\nDecision confidence — Operators must trust autonomous system decisions Failure understanding — Operators must understand failures Continuous improvement — Operators must improve systems based on audit data Operational reality: Operators will not trust non-auditable autonomous systems for critical operations.\nAuditability Requirements Observability System must be observable:\nState visibility — Can we see system state? Decision visibility — Can we see system decisions? Action visibility — Can we see system actions? Sensor visibility — Can we see sensor data? What can go wrong: System not observable, critical information not logged, logs not accessible. Observability must be designed in.\nExplainability System must be explainable:\nDecision explanation — Can we explain why decisions were made? Action explanation — Can we explain why actions were taken? Failure explanation — Can we explain why failures occurred? Operational reality: Explainability is difficult for complex systems (e.g., neural networks), but essential for trust.\nTraceability System must be traceable:\nData traceability — Can we trace data to source? Decision traceability — Can we trace decisions to inputs? Action traceability — Can we trace actions to decisions? Audit requirement: Traceability enables auditors to verify system behavior and identify causes.\nVerifiability System must be verifiable:\nPost-facto verification — Can we verify behavior after the fact? Independent verification — Can independent parties verify behavior? Cryptographic verification — Can we cryptographically verify records? Legal requirement: Verifiability enables legal defense and regulatory compliance.\nAuditability vs. Performance The Tradeoff There is often a tradeoff between auditability and performance:\nLogging overhead — Logging adds computational and storage overhead Explanation complexity — Explanation may require additional computation Design constraints — Auditability may constrain system design Operational reality: Tradeoffs must be made, but auditability should not be sacrificed for performance in critical systems.\nThe Solution Design for auditability from the start:\nBuilt-in logging — Logging designed into system architecture Efficient logging — Efficient logging to minimize overhead Selective logging — Log what matters, not everything Compression — Compress logs to reduce storage What can go wrong: Auditability added as afterthought, logging too expensive, logging incomplete. Auditability must be designed in.\nImplementation Approaches Comprehensive Logging Log everything:\nSystem state — Log all system state changes Decisions — Log all decisions and reasoning Actions — Log all actions taken Sensor data — Log all sensor data Advantages: Complete audit trail, no gaps.\nDisadvantages: High storage and computational overhead, difficult to analyze.\nSelective Logging Log what matters:\nCritical decisions — Log critical decisions and reasoning State changes — Log significant state changes Anomalies — Log anomalies and exceptions Periodic snapshots — Periodic full state snapshots Advantages: Lower overhead, easier to analyze.\nDisadvantages: May miss important information, gaps in audit trail.\nEvent Sourcing Log events, reconstruct state:\nEvent log — Log all events that change state State reconstruction — Reconstruct state from event log Immutable log — Event log is immutable Advantages: Complete audit trail, state reconstruction, time travel.\nDisadvantages: Requires event sourcing architecture, may be complex.\nRelated Topics Data Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody Audit Logs \u0026amp; Immutability Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/open-standards/auditability/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-auditability-matters-more-than-raw-autonomy\"\u003eWhy Auditability Matters More Than Raw Autonomy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs subsea systems become more autonomous, the ability to audit what happened becomes more important than the raw capability to operate autonomously.

Training must be validated.\nMission Planning Simulation for mission planning:\nMission rehearsal — Rehearse mission execution in simulation Hazard identification — Identify potential hazards and issues Procedure validation — Validate procedures before execution Resource planning — Plan resources (time, power, equipment) based on simulation Operational reality: Mission rehearsal in simulation identifies issues before real-world execution. However, simulation must be representative.\nIncident Investigation Simulation for incident investigation:\nIncident reconstruction — Reconstruct incident in simulation Hypothesis testing — Test hypotheses about what happened Root cause analysis — Understand root causes through simulation Preventive measures — Test preventive measures in simulation What can go wrong: Simulation not representative of actual conditions, incorrect assumptions, simulation results misinterpreted. Simulation must be validated against actual data.\nSimulation Benefits Safety Simulation improves safety:\nRisk reduction — Test systems and procedures without risk Failure testing — Test failure modes safely Emergency training — Train emergency response safely Procedure validation — Validate procedures before use Operational reality: Simulation cannot eliminate all risk, but it reduces risk by enabling safe testing and training.\nCost Reduction Simulation reduces cost:\nDevelopment cost — Test in simulation before building hardware Training cost — Train in simulation without operational cost Mission cost — Identify issues before execution, reducing mission time Failure cost — Identify failures before deployment, reducing failure cost What can go wrong: Simulation cost exceeds benefit, simulation not used effectively, over-investment in simulation. Cost-benefit must be assessed.\nEfficiency Simulation improves efficiency:\nFaster development — Develop and test faster in simulation Better training — Train more effectively in simulation Better planning — Plan more effectively with simulation Faster validation — Validate faster in simulation Operational reality: Simulation accelerates development and operations, but only if used effectively.\nSimulation Limitations Fidelity Limitations Simulation is not reality:\nModel accuracy — Simulation models are approximations Unknown unknowns — Simulation cannot model everything Environmental variability — Real environment is more variable than simulation System complexity — Real systems are more complex than simulation What can go wrong: Over-confidence in simulation, simulation not validated, simulation results not representative. Simulation must be validated.\nValidation Requirements Simulation must be validated:\nAgainst hardware — Validate simulation against real hardware Against operations — Validate simulation against real operations Against data — Validate simulation against operational data Continuous validation — Validation is ongoing, not one-time Responsibility: Simulation developers must validate simulation. Operators must understand simulation limitations.\nOver-Reliance Risk Over-reliance on simulation:\nFalse confidence — Simulation may create false confidence Reality gaps — Simulation may not capture reality Validation gaps — Simulation may not be validated Operational gaps — Operators may not be prepared for reality What can go wrong: Over-reliance on simulation, insufficient real-world testing, operators not prepared. Simulation complements, but does not replace, real-world testing.\nOperational Integration Simulation in Operations Simulation integrated into operations:\nPre-mission rehearsal — Rehearse missions in simulation Real-time simulation — Use simulation for real-time decision support Post-mission analysis — Analyze missions using simulation Continuous improvement — Use simulation for continuous improvement Operational reality: Simulation is most valuable when integrated into operations, not just used for development.\nSimulation Infrastructure Simulation requires infrastructure:\nComputing resources — Simulation requires computing power Software — Simulation software and licenses Models — Simulation models and data Expertise — Simulation expertise and training What can go wrong: Infrastructure not available, infrastructure not maintained, expertise not available. Simulation infrastructure must be maintained.\nRelated Topics Physics vs Control Realism Confidence Calibration Digital Twins Pre-Mission Rehearsal ","permalink":"/melon-wiki/simulation-training/why-simulation/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-simulation-matters-offshore\"\u003eWhy Simulation Matters Offshore\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimulation enables safe testing, training, and validation before real-world deployment.
