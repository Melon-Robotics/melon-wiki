[{"content":"ALARP Principles ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable. This page covers what ALARP means in practice and how to implement it for ocean operations.\nWhy This Exists ALARP is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and a best practice in others. It provides a framework for making risk decisions that balances risk reduction with practical constraints. Understanding ALARP is essential for regulatory compliance and defensible risk management.\nWho This Is For Safety officers implementing risk management Operations managers making risk decisions Regulators reviewing risk assessments Auditors verifying ALARP compliance Legal counsel defending risk decisions ALARP Definition ALARP means reducing risk to the lowest level that is:\nTechnically feasible — Can it be done with available technology? Economically reasonable — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operationally practical — Can it be implemented in practice? Key point: ALARP is not zero risk. It is the lowest risk that is reasonably practicable given constraints.\nALARP Assessment Process Step 1: Identify All Reasonably Practicable Controls For each identified risk, identify all controls that could reasonably be implemented:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or systems reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is available? What can go wrong: Controls not identified, controls dismissed without assessment, impractical controls included. Assessment must be thorough and realistic.\nStep 2: Assess Cost vs. Risk Reduction For each control, assess:\nRisk reduction — How much does this control reduce risk? (quantified where possible) Implementation cost — What does it cost to implement? (capital, operational, maintenance) Cost-effectiveness — Is the cost justified by the risk reduction? Operational reality: Cost includes not just money, but also operational complexity, maintenance burden, and other practical constraints.\nStep 3: Implement Controls Where Justified Implement controls where:\nRisk reduction is significant — Control meaningfully reduces risk Cost is reasonable — Cost is justified by risk reduction Implementation is practical — Control can be implemented in practice What can go wrong: Controls not implemented despite justification, controls implemented without justification, implementation incomplete. Decisions must be documented.\nStep 4: Document Decisions For each control decision, document:\nControl description — What control was considered? Risk reduction — How much risk reduction would it provide? Implementation cost — What would it cost to implement? Decision — Implement or not implement, and why Decision authority — Who made the decision? Legal requirement: ALARP decisions must be documented and defensible. Undocumented decisions create legal and regulatory risk.\nALARP Zones Intolerable Risk Risk that is unacceptable regardless of cost:\nMust be reduced — Risk must be reduced below intolerable level No cost-benefit analysis — Cost is not a factor; risk must be reduced Regulatory intervention — Regulators may prohibit operations if risk is intolerable Operational reality: Intolerable risk is rare but serious. Operations with intolerable risk should not proceed.\nALARP Zone Risk that is tolerable but should be reduced:\nMust demonstrate ALARP — Must show that risk is ALARP Cost-benefit analysis — Cost vs. risk reduction must be assessed Documentation required — Decisions must be documented Most operations fall here: Most operational risks are in the ALARP zone, requiring assessment and documentation.\nBroadly Acceptable Risk Risk that is so low that further reduction is not required:\nNo further action — No need to reduce risk further No documentation required — May not require detailed documentation Rare in practice — Most operational risks are not broadly acceptable Operational reality: Broadly acceptable risk is rare in commercial diving and subsea operations.\nPractical Implementation Risk Assessment Start with thorough risk assessment:\nIdentify hazards — All significant hazards must be identified Assess risk — Quantify risk where possible, qualitatively where not Compare to criteria — Compare risk to intolerable and broadly acceptable criteria What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, risk underestimated, criteria not applied correctly. Risk assessment must be thorough.\nControl Identification Identify all reasonably practicable controls:\nBrainstorm controls — Consider all possible controls Assess feasibility — Determine which controls are technically feasible Assess practicality — Determine which controls are operationally practical Operational reality: Control identification requires experience and creativity. External expertise may be needed.\nCost-Benefit Analysis Assess cost vs. risk reduction:\nQuantify risk reduction — How much does control reduce risk? (where possible) Quantify cost — What does control cost? (capital, operational, maintenance) Compare — Is cost justified by risk reduction? What can go wrong: Risk reduction overestimated, cost underestimated, comparison not done. Analysis must be realistic and documented.\nDecision Making Make and document decisions:\nDecision authority — Who has authority to make ALARP decisions? Decision process — What process is used to make decisions? Documentation — How are decisions documented? Responsibility: Management typically has decision authority. Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nCommon Pitfalls \u0026ldquo;We Can\u0026rsquo;t Afford It\u0026rdquo; Cost alone is not sufficient reason to not implement a control:\nMust assess — Cost must be assessed against risk reduction Must justify — Decision not to implement must be justified Must document — Justification must be documented What can go wrong: Controls dismissed based on cost without assessment, decisions not documented. Cost is a factor, but not the only factor.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Too Complex\u0026rdquo; Complexity alone is not sufficient reason:\nMust assess — Complexity must be assessed against risk reduction Must consider alternatives — Simpler alternatives may exist Must document — Decision must be documented Operational reality: Complexity is a valid constraint, but must be assessed, not assumed.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve Always Done It This Way\u0026rdquo; Tradition is not justification:\nMust assess — Existing practices must be assessed against ALARP Must improve — If better practices exist, they should be considered Must document — Decision to continue existing practice must be documented What can go wrong: Existing practices not assessed, better practices not considered, status quo assumed acceptable. ALARP requires continuous improvement.\nRegulatory Considerations Legal Requirements ALARP may be a legal requirement:\nUK regulations — ALARP is a legal requirement under UK health and safety law Other jurisdictions — Similar requirements may exist in other jurisdictions Industry standards — IMCA, DNV, and other standards may require ALARP Responsibility: Operators must comply with legal requirements. Non-compliance creates legal risk.\nRegulatory Review Regulators may review ALARP assessments:\nDocumentation review — Regulators may review ALARP documentation Decision challenge — Regulators may challenge ALARP decisions Enforcement — Non-compliance may result in enforcement action Audit-worthiness: ALARP documentation must be suitable for regulatory review. Inadequate documentation creates regulatory risk.\nRelated Topics Operational Risk Models Hazard Identification (HAZID/HAZOP) Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment ","permalink":"/safety-compliance/alarp/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"alarp-principles\"\u003eALARP Principles\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is a risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable.

Incident records: retain indefinitely.\nReference: IMCA M 103, ADCI Consensus Standards, USN Diving Manual Rev 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010)\nRequired Records Dive Log Entries Each dive must be logged with:\nDate and time — Start time, bottom time, surface time, completion time Location — Geographic coordinates (GPS), water depth at dive site, structure or work site ID Diver information — Diver name, certification level, certification number, medical clearance expiry Depth profile — Maximum depth (FSW), time at depth, descent and ascent rates Gas information — Gas mix specified and analyzed, O2%, He%, CO analysis date, cylinder pressures Decompression — Table and schedule used, stops completed with depths and times, deviations if any Work performed — Tasks completed, equipment used, findings, issues encountered Environmental conditions — Current speed and direction, visibility, sea state, water temperature Team composition — Supervisor name, standby diver name, tender name, DMO contact Equipment — Primary and backup equipment used, pre-dive inspection results, equipment issues Traceability: Each entry must be timestamped and attributable to a specific person. Records must be immutable once created — corrections require amendment notes, not erasures.\nEquipment Records Equipment must be tracked:\nInspection records — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance, out-of-service events Calibration records — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment, O2 analyzers Maintenance records — Repairs, replacements, modifications with part numbers and dates Failure records — Equipment failures, near-misses, corrective actions taken Audit-worthiness: Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.\nTraining Records Personnel qualifications must be documented:\nCertifications — Diver certifications (ADCI, IMCA, HSE, or equivalent), supervisor qualifications, medical fitness certificates Training history — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training, emergency drills Dive history — Cumulative dive hours, types of operations, specific qualifications (bell diving, saturation, etc.) Incident Reports Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:\nIncident description — What happened, when, where, who was involved Causal analysis — Why it happened, contributing factors, root cause Response actions — What was done in response, immediate and follow-up Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Legal sensitivity: Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate. Do not speculate or assign blame — describe what happened and what was done.\nRecord-Keeping Requirements Timeliness Records must be created:\nDuring operations — Real-time logging of depth, time, and gas data Immediately after — Post-dive debrief, decompression completion, supervisor countersignature Within 24 hours — Final log review, incident notification if required What can go wrong: Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly — records must be contemporaneous to be credible in investigation or litigation.\nAccuracy Records must use measured values, not estimates:\nDepth — From calibrated depth gauge, not estimated Time — From synchronized timepieces, not reconstructed Gas — Analyzed O2%, not assumed from cylinder label Pressure — From calibrated gauges, with before/after readings Completeness All required fields completed — no blank mandatory fields All dives logged — no skipped entries regardless of dive duration All decompression stops recorded with actual times, not planned times Immutability Records must be immutable once signed:\nNo overwriting — Errors corrected with a single line strike-through, initialed and dated Amendment process — Significant corrections require a separate amendment note with reason, date, and signature No backdating — All entries dated and timed at creation Data Provenance Records must demonstrate data provenance:\nSource — Where did the data originate? Instrument? Observation? Calculation? Method — Direct measurement, estimation, or derived value? Chain of custody — Who recorded the data, who verified it, how was it transferred? Audit-worthiness: Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors. Records that cannot be traced to a source are not credible.\nStorage \u0026amp; Retention Storage Requirements Secure storage — Protected from loss, damage, fire, water, and unauthorized access Backup — Redundant copies in separate physical locations or cloud storage with access controls Access control — Only authorized personnel can view or modify records Format — Readable format that will remain accessible for the full retention period Retention Periods Record Type Minimum Retention Basis Dive logs (routine) 5 years IMCA M 103, ADCI Equipment inspection records 5 years or equipment life Manufacturer / regulator Training \u0026amp; certification records Duration of employment + 5 years Standard practice Incident reports Indefinite Statute of limitations Personal injury records Indefinite Legal requirement Gas analysis records 5 years Standard practice Operational reality: Many jurisdictions and contracts require retention beyond these minimums. When in doubt, retain longer.\nDigital vs. Paper Records Digital records — Advantages: searchable, easily backed up, can support audit trails, integrates with decompression software. Challenges: format obsolescence, system dependencies, cybersecurity requirements, integrity verification.\nPaper records — Advantages: universally readable, legally established, no technology dependency. Challenges: physical storage, difficult to search at scale, backup requires physical copying.\nBest practice: Dual records (digital primary, paper backup for critical dives) provide the advantages of both. The paper record must be a faithful copy of the digital record, not a summary.\nAudit Requirements Records must support the following audit types:\nRegulatory audits — IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, flag state, coastal state Client audits — Third-party verification of contract compliance Insurance audits — Risk assessment and claims verification Internal audits — Quality assurance and continuous improvement What auditors look for: Complete entries, supervisor signatures, calibration records, training records cross-referenced to personnel, gas analysis certificates, incident report trails. Gaps in any of these create audit findings.\nFrequently Asked Questions What must be in a commercial diving log? Every commercial dive log entry must include: date and times (start, max depth, surfaced), GPS location, diver identity and certification, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2%, decompression schedule followed and any deviations, work performed, environmental conditions, and supervisor signature. See the printable template above for a complete field reference.\nHow long must records be kept? Minimum 5 years for routine logs (IMCA/ADCI). Indefinite for incident reports and records involving personal injury. Many operators keep all records for 7-10 years. Check your contract, your jurisdiction, and your insurer\u0026rsquo;s requirements — they may be more stringent.\nWhat makes a record legally defensible? Contemporaneous creation (not reconstructed from memory), measured values from calibrated instruments, complete required fields, supervisor countersignature, immutable storage with audit trail. Records that can be shown to have been altered, backdated, or estimated rather than measured are not credible in legal proceedings.\nRelated Topics USN Dive Tables — Decompression table reference Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment Ocean Data \u0026amp; Trust — Data provenance and integrity principles Safety, Risk \u0026amp; Compliance — Regulatory requirements ","permalink":"/commercial-diving/dive-logs/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"commercial-dive-logs--operational-records\"\u003eCommercial Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDive logs and operational records provide traceability and auditability for commercial diving operations.

This page covers acoustic, RF, and hybrid communication systems, their capabilities, limitations, and failure modes.\nWhy This Exists Communication enables coordination, control, and data transfer in subsea operations. Understanding communication options, tradeoffs, and failure modes is essential for designing and operating multi-vehicle systems.\nWho This Is For Robotics engineers designing communication systems Operations managers planning multi-vehicle operations ROV pilots operating in communication-limited environments System architects designing networked systems Communication Options Acoustic Communication Acoustic modems use sound waves to transmit data through water:\nRange — Typically 1-10km depending on frequency and power Bandwidth — Low bandwidth (typically \u0026lt;10 kbps) Latency — High latency (speed of sound in water ~1500 m/s) Reliability — Affected by noise, multipath, and environmental conditions Operational reality: Acoustic communication is the standard for long-range subsea communication, but it is slow and unreliable.\nWhat can go wrong: Communication loss due to range, noise, multipath, equipment failure. Acoustic communication is inherently unreliable.\nRF Communication Radio frequency communication through water:\nRange — Very limited (typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater) Bandwidth — Higher bandwidth than acoustic (typically 100+ kbps) Latency — Low latency (speed of light) Reliability — Good reliability at short range Operational reality: RF is only practical at very short range. Seawater is highly conductive, severely limiting RF range.\nWhat can go wrong: Range exceeded, interference, equipment failure. RF is not practical for most subsea operations.\nHybrid Systems Combining acoustic and RF:\nAcoustic for long-range — Use acoustic for vehicle-to-surface or vehicle-to-vehicle at range RF for short-range — Use RF for high-bandwidth at short range Automatic switching — Switch between systems based on range and requirements Operational reality: Hybrid systems provide best of both worlds, but add complexity.\nWhat can go wrong: Switching failures, system complexity, increased failure modes. Hybrid systems must be carefully designed.\nTether (ROV) Hard-wired connection for ROVs:\nRange — Limited by tether length (typically \u0026lt;1000m) Bandwidth — Very high bandwidth (fiber optic) Latency — Very low latency Reliability — High reliability if tether intact Operational reality: Tether provides best communication but limits vehicle mobility and range.\nWhat can go wrong: Tether damage, tether length limitations, entanglement. Tether is not practical for all operations.\nCommunication Characteristics Latency Communication latency affects:\nReal-time control — High latency makes real-time control difficult Coordination — High latency affects coordination capability Data freshness — High latency means data is stale when received Operational reality: Acoustic latency (speed of sound) is ~0.67 seconds per kilometer. At 5km range, round-trip latency is ~6.7 seconds. This is too slow for real-time control.\nBandwidth Communication bandwidth affects:\nData transfer — How much data can be transferred Video feeds — High-bandwidth required for video Sensor data — Bandwidth limits sensor data transfer Operational reality: Acoustic bandwidth is typically \u0026lt;10 kbps, insufficient for video. RF provides higher bandwidth but limited range.\nReliability Communication reliability affects:\nMission success — Unreliable communication may cause mission failure Safety — Unreliable communication creates safety risk Coordination — Unreliable communication makes coordination difficult What can go wrong: Communication loss, intermittent communication, degraded communication. Systems must be designed for unreliable communication.\nFailure Modes Range Exceeded Communication lost because range exceeded:\nAcoustic — Range typically 1-10km depending on conditions RF — Range typically \u0026lt;100m in seawater Tether — Range limited by tether length Response: Vehicle must operate autonomously when communication lost. See Loss-of-Comms Behavior.\nEnvironmental Interference Communication degraded by environmental conditions:\nAcoustic noise — Ship noise, biological noise, other acoustic sources Multipath — Acoustic signals reflected off surfaces Attenuation — Signal strength reduced by distance and conditions What can go wrong: Communication degraded or lost due to environmental conditions. Systems must be robust to environmental interference.\nEquipment Failure Communication equipment fails:\nModem failure — Acoustic or RF modem fails Antenna failure — Antenna damaged or disconnected Power failure — Communication equipment loses power Response: Backup communication systems, or vehicle operates autonomously. See Graceful Degradation.\nCommunication Protocols Message-Based Protocols Send discrete messages:\nAdvantages — Simple, robust to loss, works with low bandwidth Disadvantages — No continuous data streams, higher overhead Operational reality: Message-based protocols are common for acoustic communication due to low bandwidth and high latency.\nStream-Based Protocols Continuous data streams:\nAdvantages — Efficient for continuous data, lower overhead Disadvantages — Requires reliable connection, not suitable for low bandwidth Operational reality: Stream-based protocols are used for tethered systems with high bandwidth and low latency.\nHybrid Protocols Combine message-based and stream-based:\nMessages for control — Use messages for commands and status Streams for data — Use streams for high-bandwidth data when available Operational reality: Hybrid protocols provide flexibility but add complexity.\nOperational Considerations Communication Planning Plan communication for operations:\nRange requirements — What range is needed? Bandwidth requirements — What bandwidth is needed? Latency requirements — What latency is acceptable? Reliability requirements — What reliability is needed? What can go wrong: Communication not planned, requirements not met, backup not available. Communication planning is essential.\nBackup Communication Provide backup communication:\nMultiple systems — Acoustic and RF, or multiple acoustic systems Redundant equipment — Backup modems and antennas Alternative methods — Surface-to-surface coordination, visual signals Operational reality: Backup communication is essential. Single point of failure is unacceptable.\nAutonomous Operation Vehicles must operate autonomously:\nWhen communication lost — Vehicle continues mission autonomously When communication degraded — Vehicle adapts to available communication Pre-programmed behavior — Vehicle follows pre-programmed procedures Responsibility: Vehicle designers must ensure autonomous capability. Operators must understand autonomous behavior.\nRelated Topics Multi-Vehicle Coordination Latency \u0026amp; Bandwidth Tradeoffs Graceful Degradation Loss-of-Comms Behavior ","permalink":"/swarm-systems/communications/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"communication-systems\"\u003eCommunication Systems\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubsea communication is fundamentally different from terrestrial communication.

Chain-of-custody tracks data as it moves through systems and organizations. This page covers why this matters for ocean operations and how to implement it in practice.\nWhy This Exists Data provenance enables:\nAudit verification — Auditors can verify data accuracy by tracing to source Incident investigation — Investigators can reconstruct what happened from data records Regulatory compliance — Regulators require traceable data for compliance verification Legal defense — Provenance protects operators in disputes by demonstrating data integrity Operational trust — Operators can trust data when they know its source and handling What can go wrong: Data without provenance cannot be verified, data with broken chain-of-custody is not credible, missing provenance creates legal and operational risk.\nWho This Is For Data engineers designing data systems Operations personnel recording operational data Auditors verifying data accuracy Incident investigators reconstructing events Legal counsel defending operations Regulators reviewing compliance Provenance Requirements Source Identification Every data record must identify:\nSource system — What system created the data? (sensor, instrument, calculation, human entry) Source location — Where was the data created? (vehicle, surface system, geographic location) Creation method — How was the data created? (direct measurement, calculation, estimation, observation) Creation time — When was the data created? (timestamp with timezone and synchronization method) Operational reality: Source identification must be automatic where possible. Manual entry is error-prone and should be minimized.\nTransformation Tracking When data is transformed, track:\nTransformation type — What transformation was applied? (filtering, calibration, unit conversion, calculation) Transformation parameters — What parameters were used? (calibration coefficients, filter settings, algorithm version) Transformation time — When was the transformation applied? Transformation system — What system performed the transformation? What can go wrong: Transformations not documented, transformation parameters lost, transformations applied incorrectly. Each transformation must be traceable.\nChain-of-Custody As data moves through systems, track:\nTransfer events — When data was transferred, from where to where Transfer method — How data was transferred (network, storage media, manual) Transfer integrity — How integrity was verified (checksums, signatures) Custodian — Who or what system had custody at each point Legal requirement: Chain-of-custody must be unbroken. Gaps in chain-of-custody reduce data credibility in legal proceedings.\nImplementation Approaches Metadata Embedding Embed provenance in data records:\nStructured metadata — JSON, XML, or structured fields in data records Header information — Provenance in file headers or message headers Database fields — Provenance columns in database tables Advantages: Provenance travels with data, no separate tracking system required.\nChallenges: Metadata can be lost or altered, requires discipline to maintain.\nSeparate Provenance Logs Maintain separate logs tracking data:\nEvent logs — Log each data creation, transformation, and transfer event Data registry — Registry mapping data identifiers to provenance records Audit trails — Immutable audit trails of all data operations Advantages: Centralized tracking, easier to audit, can be made tamper-resistant.\nChallenges: Requires infrastructure, must be kept synchronized with data.\nHybrid Approaches Combine embedding and logging:\nEmbedded metadata — Lightweight provenance in data records Centralized logs — Detailed provenance in centralized systems Cross-references — Data records reference centralized logs Operational reality: Hybrid approaches balance convenience and auditability. Most practical systems use hybrid approaches.\nProvenance for Different Data Types Sensor Data Sensor data provenance must include:\nSensor identification — Sensor type, serial number, calibration status Measurement conditions — Environmental conditions, sensor configuration Calibration information — Calibration date, coefficients, traceability Data acquisition — Sampling rate, filtering, timestamp synchronization What can go wrong: Sensor misidentified, calibration not recorded, conditions not documented. Sensor data without provenance is not credible.\nCalculated Data Calculated data provenance must include:\nInput data — What data was used as input? (with provenance) Calculation method — What algorithm or formula was used? Calculation parameters — What parameters were used? Calculation system — What system performed the calculation? (software version, configuration) What can go wrong: Input data not identified, calculation method not documented, parameters lost. Calculated data must be reproducible.\nHuman-Entered Data Human-entered data provenance must include:\nEntered by — Who entered the data? Entry time — When was it entered? Entry method — How was it entered? (form, log, voice transcription) Source information — What was the source of the information? (observation, measurement, communication) What can go wrong: Entered by not recorded, entry time inaccurate, source not documented. Human-entered data requires careful provenance tracking.\nChain-of-Custody Procedures Data Transfer When transferring data:\nVerify source — Confirm data source and provenance Transfer securely — Use secure transfer methods with integrity verification Record transfer — Log transfer event with timestamp and parties Verify receipt — Confirm data received and integrity verified Update custody — Update chain-of-custody records Responsibility: Both sender and receiver must verify and record transfer.\nData Storage When storing data:\nSecure storage — Protect from unauthorized access and modification Access logging — Log all access to stored data Integrity verification — Regularly verify data integrity (checksums, signatures) Backup procedures — Backup data with provenance intact What can go wrong: Unauthorized access, data modification, integrity loss, backup without provenance. Storage systems must protect data and provenance.\nData Access When accessing data:\nAccess logging — Log who accessed what data when Purpose documentation — Document why data was accessed Integrity verification — Verify data integrity before use Provenance review — Review provenance before relying on data Audit requirement: Access logs must be maintained for audit. Unauthorized or undocumented access creates risk.\nVerification \u0026amp; Validation Provenance Verification Verify provenance:\nSource verification — Can source be verified? Is source credible? Chain verification — Is chain-of-custody unbroken? Transformation verification — Can transformations be verified? Are they correct? Timeline verification — Do timestamps make sense? Are they consistent? What can go wrong: Provenance cannot be verified, chain-of-custody broken, transformations incorrect, timestamps inconsistent. Unverifiable provenance reduces data credibility.\nData Validation Validate data against provenance:\nSource validation — Does data match expected source characteristics? Range validation — Is data within expected ranges for source? Consistency validation — Is data consistent with other data from same source? Temporal validation — Does data make sense temporally? Operational reality: Validation catches errors early. Invalid data should trigger investigation.\nRegulatory \u0026amp; Legal Considerations Regulatory Requirements Regulators may require:\nProvenance documentation — Detailed provenance records Chain-of-custody maintenance — Unbroken chain-of-custody Audit access — Ability for regulators to audit provenance Retention — Provenance records retained for specified periods Responsibility: Operators must comply with regulatory requirements.

This page covers the frameworks and considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Proper dive planning prevents incidents. By identifying hazards, assessing risks, and developing response procedures before the dive, operations can proceed with clear understanding of what can go wrong and how to respond.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning operations Commercial divers reviewing dive plans Safety officers assessing operational risk Auditors reviewing planning procedures Contractors developing operational procedures Planning Framework Hazard Identification Before planning, identify all hazards:\nEnvironmental hazards — Current, visibility, sea state, temperature, marine life Equipment hazards — Equipment failure modes, umbilical management, tool hazards Task hazards — Work complexity, confined spaces, entanglement risks Human factors — Fatigue, experience level, team composition Organizational hazards — Communication protocols, emergency response capability, support resources What can go wrong: Hazards not identified, hazards underestimated, new hazards emerge during operations. Planning must be thorough and account for uncertainty.\nRisk Assessment For each identified hazard, assess:\nLikelihood — How likely is this hazard to cause an incident? Severity — How severe would the consequences be? Mitigation — What controls reduce likelihood or severity? Residual risk — What risk remains after mitigation? Operational reality: Risk assessment is not academic. It must reflect actual operational conditions and account for how operations degrade under stress.\nControl Measures Develop control measures for each significant risk:\nElimination — Can the hazard be eliminated? Substitution — Can a less hazardous approach be used? Engineering controls — Can equipment or procedures reduce risk? Administrative controls — Can procedures, training, or supervision reduce risk? Personal protective equipment — What PPE is required? What can go wrong: Controls not implemented, controls ineffective, controls degrade during operations. Controls must be practical and verifiable.\nEmergency Procedures For each significant risk, develop emergency response procedures:\nTrigger conditions — What conditions trigger emergency response? Response actions — What actions are taken in response? Responsibility — Who is responsible for each action? Communication — How is emergency communicated? Recovery — How is normal operations restored? Responsibility boundaries: Emergency procedures must clearly define who does what. Ambiguity in emergency response leads to delayed or incorrect actions.\nDive Plan Components Operational Parameters Depth — Maximum operating depth Bottom time — Planned bottom time and decompression schedule Gas requirements — Gas mix, volume, and consumption estimates Work scope — Tasks to be performed and equipment required Environmental conditions — Expected current, visibility, sea state What can go wrong: Parameters set beyond equipment or diver capabilities, environmental conditions worse than expected, work scope exceeds available time. Plans must be conservative and account for uncertainty.\nTeam Composition Diver — Primary diver qualifications and experience Standby diver — Standby diver qualifications and readiness Supervisor — Supervisor qualifications and experience Support personnel — Tenders, equipment operators, medical support Human factors: Team composition affects operational capability. Inexperienced teams require more conservative planning.\nEquipment Requirements Diving equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment Surface equipment — Gas supply, communication, monitoring, recovery Emergency equipment — Standby diver equipment, emergency gas, medical equipment Backup systems — Redundant systems for critical functions What can go wrong: Equipment not available, equipment not functional, backup systems not tested. Equipment must be verified before dive commences.\nCommunication Protocols Check-in procedures — Frequency and format of check-ins Emergency communication — How emergencies are communicated Backup communication — Alternative communication methods Surface-to-surface communication — Coordination with other operations Operational reality: Communication protocols must work in practice, not just on paper. Test communication before operations.\nRisk Assessment Methods Qualitative Risk Assessment Simple risk matrix approach:\nLikelihood: Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain Severity: Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic Risk level: Low, Medium, High, Extreme Use when: Quick assessment needed, resources limited, risk levels clearly distinguishable.\nWhat can go wrong: Subjective assessment, inconsistent application, risks underestimated. Requires experienced assessors.\nQuantitative Risk Assessment Numerical assessment of likelihood and consequences:\nProbability estimates — Based on historical data or expert judgment Consequence estimates — Quantified in terms of injury, equipment damage, or operational impact Risk calculation — Probability × Consequence = Risk Use when: Detailed analysis required, historical data available, regulatory requirements mandate quantitative assessment.\nWhat can go wrong: False precision, data not applicable to current conditions, calculations not understood by operational personnel. Results must be interpreted in operational context.\nALARP Assessment As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) assessment:\nIdentify all reasonably practicable controls Assess cost vs. risk reduction for each control Implement controls where risk reduction justifies cost Document why controls are or are not implemented Use when: Regulatory requirements mandate ALARP, high-risk operations, significant resources available for risk reduction.\nResponsibility: Management decides what is \u0026ldquo;reasonably practicable.\u0026rdquo; Decisions must be documented and defensible.\nPre-Dive Briefing Before dive commences, conduct briefing covering:\nDive plan review — Parameters, procedures, and emergency response Hazard review — Identified hazards and control measures Team roles — Responsibilities of each team member Communication protocols — Check-in procedures and emergency communication Equipment verification — Confirmation that all equipment is ready What can go wrong: Briefing not conducted, briefing incomplete, team members not paying attention. Briefing must be interactive and verified.\nPost-Dive Review After dive completion, review:\nPlan vs. execution — What differed from plan and why? Hazards encountered — Were all hazards identified? Any new hazards? Control effectiveness — Did controls work as intended? Lessons learned — What should be done differently next time? Operational improvement: Post-dive review drives continuous improvement. Document lessons learned and update procedures.\nRegulatory Considerations Dive planning must comply with applicable regulations:\nIMCA guidelines — International Marine Contractors Association guidelines ADCI standards — Association of Diving Contractors International standards National regulations — Country-specific requirements Client requirements — Contract-specific requirements Responsibility: Operator ensures compliance. Auditors verify compliance. Non-compliance creates legal and operational risk.\nRelated Topics Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Emergency Response Frameworks Safety, Risk \u0026amp; Compliance Human Factors in Diving Operations ","permalink":"/commercial-diving/dive-planning/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"dive-planning--risk-assessment\"\u003eDive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDive planning is the process of identifying hazards, assessing risks, and developing operational procedures before a dive commences.

This page provides the operational structure for emergency response, not medical or rescue instruction.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning emergency response Safety officers developing emergency procedures Operations managers ensuring emergency readiness Auditors reviewing emergency procedures Emergency Response Structure Response Roles Emergency response requires defined roles:\nIncident commander — Overall responsibility for emergency response Dive supervisor — Diving-specific response coordination Standby diver — Immediate response capability Medical support — Medical response (if available) Surface support — Surface equipment and personnel Responsibility boundaries: Each role must have clear responsibilities. Ambiguity in roles leads to delayed or incorrect response.\nDecision-Making Authority Emergency response requires clear decision-making:\nWho decides — Who has authority to make emergency decisions? Decision criteria — What criteria guide emergency decisions? Escalation — When are decisions escalated? Documentation — How are emergency decisions documented? Operational reality: Emergency decisions must be made quickly. Decision-making authority must be clear and documented.\nResource Availability Emergency response requires resources:\nPersonnel — Trained personnel available for response Equipment — Emergency equipment ready and functional Communication — Communication systems for coordination Medical — Medical support available (if applicable) What can go wrong: Resources not available, resources not ready, resources not sufficient.

Immediate response must be practiced and automatic.\nResponse Execution Execution of response procedures:\nFollow procedures — Execute documented procedures Adapt as needed — Adapt procedures to circumstances Coordinate resources — Coordinate available resources Document actions — Document all response actions Operational reality: Procedures provide framework, but response must adapt to circumstances. Documentation is essential for post-incident review.\nPost-Emergency Actions after emergency resolved:\nSecure situation — Ensure situation is secure Assess condition — Assess condition of personnel and equipment Debrief — Conduct debrief of response Document incident — Document incident and response Responsibility: Supervisor ensures proper post-emergency procedures. Documentation is essential for learning and improvement.\nCommunication During Emergency Emergency Communication Communication during emergency:\nAlert communication — How emergency is communicated Status updates — Regular status updates during response Resource coordination — Communication for resource coordination External communication — Communication with external resources (if needed) What can go wrong: Communication breakdown, unclear communication, delayed communication. Emergency communication must be practiced and reliable.\nBackup Communication Backup communication methods:\nAlternative systems — Alternative communication systems Visual signals — Visual signals when communication lost Surface-to-surface — Surface-to-surface coordination External resources — Communication with external resources Operational reality: Backup communication is essential. Single point of failure is unacceptable.\nMedical Considerations Medical Support Medical support availability:\nOn-site medical — Medical personnel on-site (if available) Remote medical — Remote medical consultation (if available) Medical equipment — Medical equipment available Evacuation — Medical evacuation capability (if available) Operational reality: Medical support varies by operation. Operations must plan for available medical support.\nMedical Decision-Making Medical decision-making during emergency:\nWho decides — Who has medical decision-making authority? Decision criteria — What criteria guide medical decisions? Documentation — How are medical decisions documented? Legal sensitivity: Medical decisions have legal implications.

pilots and supervisors Operations managers planning missions Safety officers assessing operational risk Robotics engineers designing systems Auditors reviewing operational procedures Failure Mode Categories Single Point Failures Failures that immediately disable the system:\nPower loss — Complete loss of vehicle power Tether severance — Complete loss of connection Critical sensor failure — Loss of essential situational awareness Control system failure — Loss of vehicle control Operational impact: Mission abort, emergency recovery required.\nWhat can go wrong: No recovery possible, vehicle lost, mission failure.\nDegraded Mode Failures Failures that reduce capability but allow continued operations:\nThruster failure — Reduced maneuverability Sensor degradation — Reduced situational awareness Manipulator failure — Loss of work capability Communication degradation — Reduced data bandwidth Operational impact: Reduced capability, mission may continue with limitations.\nWhat can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nCascading Failures Initial failure leads to additional failures:\nTether damage → Power loss → Vehicle loss Thruster failure → Loss of control → Collision → Vehicle damage Sensor failure → Loss of awareness → Navigation error → Entanglement Operational impact: Rapid degradation, mission abort likely.\nWhat can go wrong: Cascading failures are difficult to predict and may progress faster than recovery procedures can execute.\nSpecific Failure Modes Power System Failures Primary power loss:\nCauses: Generator failure, tether damage, power distribution failure Effect: Immediate loss of vehicle power, unresponsive vehicle Recovery: Switch to backup power, or recover via winch if tether intact Prevention: Redundant power systems, backup generators, power monitoring Battery failure (AUV):\nCauses: Battery degradation, over-discharge, thermal issues Effect: Loss of propulsion and systems, vehicle may surface or sink Recovery: Emergency surface procedures, recovery at surface Prevention: Battery monitoring, conservative depth-of-discharge limits What can go wrong: Backup power not available, backup power insufficient, recovery procedures not executed correctly.\nCommunication Failures Tether severance (ROV):\nCauses: Snagging, excessive tension, mechanical damage Effect: Complete loss of communication and power Recovery: Vehicle may have emergency systems (acoustic release, buoyancy), surface recovery Prevention: Tether management, tension monitoring, protective routing Acoustic link loss (AUV):\nCauses: Range exceeded, acoustic interference, equipment failure Effect: Loss of real-time communication, vehicle continues mission or enters failsafe Recovery: Vehicle may surface at pre-programmed waypoint, or continue mission autonomously Prevention: Range management, acoustic link monitoring, failsafe programming What can go wrong: Emergency systems not functional, failsafe procedures not executed, vehicle lost.\nSensor Failures Camera failure:\nCauses: Water ingress, electronics failure, mechanical damage Effect: Loss of primary situational awareness Recovery: Continue with remaining cameras, or abort if no backup Prevention: Redundant cameras, watertight housings, pre-dive testing

sensors, or abort if navigation critical Prevention: Redundant sonar systems, pre-dive testing INS failure:\nCauses: Sensor failure, calibration drift, initialization error Effect: Loss of precise navigation, position uncertainty increases Recovery: Continue with dead reckoning, or abort if precision required Prevention: Redundant INS systems, regular calibration, initialization checks What can go wrong: Multiple sensor failures, no backup sensors, operations continue beyond safe limits.\nPropulsion Failures Thruster failure:\nCauses: Mechanical failure, electrical failure, entanglement Effect: Reduced maneuverability, inability to maintain position Recovery: Continue with remaining thrusters, or abort if insufficient control Prevention: Redundant thrusters, pre-dive testing, thruster monitoring Thruster entanglement:\nCauses: Debris, fishing line, umbilical contact Effect: Thruster unable to rotate, reduced or asymmetric thrust Recovery: Attempt to clear entanglement, or abort if unable to clear Prevention: Thruster guards, operational awareness, careful maneuvering What can go wrong: Multiple thruster failures, asymmetric failures cause instability, recovery not possible.\nManipulator Failures Manipulator mechanical failure:\nCauses: Overload, mechanical wear, water ingress Effect: Loss of work capability, manipulator may be stuck or uncontrolled Recovery: Abort work tasks, continue inspection if possible Prevention: Load monitoring, regular maintenance, pre-dive testing Tool failure:\nCauses: Tool-specific failures (cutting tool, sampling tool, etc.) Effect: Specific work task cannot be performed Recovery: Switch to backup tool, or abort specific task Prevention: Redundant tools, tool testing, proper tool selection What can go wrong: No backup tools, tool failure causes vehicle damage, mission objectives not achievable.\nRecovery Procedures Emergency Recovery When immediate recovery is required:\nAbort mission — Cease all work tasks, prepare for recovery Assess situation — Determine recovery method based on failure mode Execute recovery — Winch recovery (ROV), surface procedures (AUV), or alternative method Secure vehicle — Once recovered, secure vehicle and assess damage Document incident — Record failure mode, recovery actions, lessons learned Responsibility: Supervisor directs recovery; pilot executes recovery procedures.\nDegraded Operations When operations can continue with limitations:\nAssess capability — Determine remaining operational capability Revise mission — Adjust mission objectives to match capability Increase monitoring — Enhanced monitoring for additional failures Prepare recovery — Ready recovery procedures in case of further degradation Document status — Record degraded status and operational limitations What can go wrong: Degraded operations exceed safe limits, secondary failures occur, mission objectives not achievable.\nFailure Prevention Design Principles Redundancy — Critical systems should have backups Monitoring — Systems should monitor their own health Failsafes — Systems should fail to safe states Isolation — Failures should not cascade to other systems Operational reality: Redundancy adds cost and complexity. Tradeoffs must be made based on operational requirements and risk tolerance.\nOperational Practices Pre-dive testing — Verify all systems before deployment Regular maintenance — Prevent failures through maintenance Operational limits — Operate within system capabilities Training — Operators must understand failure modes and recovery What can go wrong: Testing incomplete, maintenance deferred, limits exceeded, training insufficient.\nData \u0026amp; Records Failure documentation must include:\nFailure description — What failed, when, under what conditions Root cause — Why it failed (if determinable) Operational impact — How operations were affected Recovery actions — What was done to recover Preventive measures — What will prevent recurrence Audit-worthiness: Failure records must be complete, accurate, and suitable for regulatory review.

Actual operational depth depends on tether length, power requirements, and mission duration.\nWork Capabilities ROVs can perform:\nInspection — Visual inspection, NDT, structural assessment Manipulation — Tool use, object recovery, installation Survey — Bathymetry, pipeline inspection, seabed mapping Sampling — Environmental sampling, biological sampling Construction — Pipeline installation, structure assembly What can go wrong: Work tasks exceed vehicle capability, tools not compatible, manipulator reach limitations, visibility constraints. Work scope must match vehicle capability.\nEndurance ROV endurance depends on:\nPower consumption — Vehicle systems, sensors, manipulators Surface power — Generator capacity and fuel supply Tether length — Power loss over tether length Mission profile — Station-keeping vs. transit, tool use intensity Operational reality: Endurance is not unlimited. Power management is critical for extended operations.\nFailure Modes Vehicle Failures Thruster failure:\nEffect: Reduced maneuverability, inability to maintain position Degradation: Vehicle may still be recoverable with remaining thrusters Response: Abort mission, recover vehicle, repair or replace thruster Buoyancy system failure:\nEffect: Inability to control depth, potential uncontrolled ascent/descent Degradation: Vehicle may become unstable or uncontrollable Response: Emergency recovery procedures, surface intervention Sensor failure:\nEffect: Loss of situational awareness, inability to perform tasks Degradation: Operations may continue with reduced capability Response: Continue with available sensors, or abort if critical sensor fails Manipulator failure:\nEffect: Inability to perform work tasks Degradation: Inspection-only operations may continue Response: Abort work tasks, continue inspection if possible Tether Failures Tether damage:\nEffect: Power loss, communication loss, or both Degradation: Partial failure may allow limited operations Response: Immediate recovery, assess damage, repair or replace Tether entanglement:\nEffect: Vehicle movement restricted, potential tether damage Degradation: Operations may continue with reduced mobility Response: Attempt to clear entanglement, or recover if unable to clear Power loss:\nEffect: Vehicle loses power, becomes unresponsive Degradation: Vehicle may be recoverable via winch if tether intact Response: Emergency recovery procedures, surface recovery Surface System Failures Control system failure:\nEffect: Loss of vehicle control Degradation: Vehicle may continue last command or enter failsafe mode Response: Switch to backup control system, or initiate recovery Power supply failure:\nEffect: Loss of surface power, vehicle loses power Degradation: Backup power may allow controlled recovery Response: Switch to backup power, recover vehicle Winch failure:\nEffect: Inability to deploy or recover vehicle Degradation: Vehicle may remain operational but unrecoverable Response: Repair winch, or use alternative recovery method Operational Procedures Pre-Dive Checks Before deployment, verify:\nVehicle systems — All systems functional, sensors calibrated Tether — No damage, proper routing, adequate length Surface systems — Control, power, winch all operational Tools and payload — Required equipment installed and functional Emergency procedures — Recovery procedures understood and ready Responsibility: ROV supervisor verifies systems; pilot verifies controls. Both must confirm before deployment.\nDuring Operations Standard operational practices:\nVehicle monitoring — Continuous monitoring of vehicle status Tether management — Monitoring tether position and condition Mission execution — Following planned work procedures Data recording — Continuous recording of mission data Communication — Regular status updates to surface team What can go wrong: Task fixation, missed anomalies, tether management errors, communication breakdown. Pilots must maintain situational awareness.\nPost-Dive Procedures After recovery:\nVehicle inspection — Post-dive inspection for damage Data download — Mission data retrieval and backup Equipment maintenance — Cleaning, inspection, repairs as needed Debrief — Mission review, lessons learned, documentation Responsibility: Supervisor ensures proper recovery and documentation; pilot reports any issues or anomalies.\nHuman Factors ROV operations depend on human operators:\nPilot skill — Experience and training affect operational capability Fatigue — Extended operations lead to degraded performance Situational awareness — Limited by sensor data and video feeds Decision-making — Operators must make decisions with incomplete information What can go wrong: Operator error, fatigue-induced mistakes, loss of situational awareness, poor decision-making. Human factors must be managed through procedures and training.\nData \u0026amp; Records ROV operations generate records:\nMission logs — Vehicle position, depth, time, tasks performed Video records — Camera feeds recorded for later analysis Sensor data — Sonar, depth, attitude, environmental data Equipment records — Maintenance, repairs, failures Incident reports — Anomalies, near-misses, incidents Audit-worthiness: Records must be traceable, timestamped, and suitable for regulatory review.

This page covers the equipment, procedures, and operational considerations that matter in practice.\nWhy This Exists Surface-supplied diving provides continuous gas supply, real-time communication, and direct surface supervision. Unlike scuba, the diver remains connected to the surface, enabling longer bottom times, better safety oversight, and support for complex work tasks.\nWho This Is For Commercial divers working surface-supplied Dive supervisors planning and overseeing operations Tenders and support personnel Safety officers reviewing procedures Auditors assessing operational compliance System Components Gas Supply System The surface gas supply provides breathing gas to the diver through an umbilical. In practice, this means:\nPrimary gas supply — Typically air or nitrox for shallow work, helium-oxygen (heliox) or trimix for deeper operations Backup gas supply — Independent secondary system with sufficient capacity for emergency ascent Gas quality monitoring — Continuous analysis of oxygen content, contaminants, and pressure Emergency gas — Bailout cylinder carried by diver for emergency ascent What can go wrong: Gas supply failure, contamination, incorrect gas mix, umbilical damage. Each failure mode requires specific response procedures documented in dive plans.\nDiving Umbilical The umbilical carries gas, communication, and sometimes power to the diver. Operational considerations:\nGas hose — Primary breathing gas supply, typically 3/8\u0026quot; to 1/2\u0026quot; ID Communication cable — Hard-wired or fiber-optic voice communication Hot water hose — For thermal protection in cold water (if applicable) Strength member — Steel wire or Kevlar strength member for load handling Umbilical management — Tending, deployment, and recovery procedures What can go wrong: Umbilical entanglement, damage from sharp edges, communication loss, gas supply interruption. Umbilical management is a critical operational skill.\nDiving Helmet or Full-Face Mask The diver\u0026rsquo;s interface with the surface-supplied system:\nHelmet systems — Hard hat with integrated communication, gas supply, and exhaust Full-face mask systems — Lighter weight alternative with similar functionality Communication — Hard-wired voice communication with surface Gas flow — Demand valve or free-flow system depending on design What can go wrong: Communication failure, mask flooding, gas flow interruption, vision obstruction. Divers must be trained in emergency procedures for each failure mode.\nDiver Monitoring Surface personnel monitor diver status through:\nVoice communication — Continuous or periodic check-ins Depth monitoring — Depth gauge or transducer on surface Gas consumption — Flow meters and pressure monitoring Visual observation — When visibility permits, direct observation from surface What can go wrong: Communication loss, depth monitoring failure, missed check-ins. Supervisors must have clear procedures for handling loss of communication.\nOperational Procedures Pre-Dive Checks Before each dive, verify:\nGas supply — Primary and backup systems operational, correct gas mix, sufficient volume Umbilical — No damage, proper routing, adequate length for planned work Communication — Two-way communication functional, backup communication available Diver equipment — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment checked Surface support — Tender, supervisor, standby diver, emergency equipment ready Responsibility: Dive supervisor verifies surface systems; diver verifies personal equipment. Both must confirm before dive commences.\nDuring Dive Operations Standard operational practices:\nCheck-in procedures — Regular voice check-ins at specified intervals Depth/time tracking — Continuous monitoring of depth and bottom time Gas management — Monitoring consumption and remaining supply Work task execution — Following planned work procedures Umbilical management — Maintaining proper umbilical routing and avoiding entanglement What can go wrong: Task fixation leading to missed check-ins, umbilical entanglement, gas consumption exceeding plan, communication degradation. Supervisors must maintain situational awareness and intervene when necessary.\nPost-Dive Procedures After dive completion:\nEquipment recovery — Safe recovery of diver and umbilical Equipment inspection — Post-dive inspection for damage or wear Debrief — Discussion of dive execution, issues encountered, lessons learned Documentation — Recording dive details in dive log Responsibility: Supervisor ensures proper recovery and documentation; diver reports any issues or anomalies.\nFailure Modes \u0026amp; Response Communication Loss What happens: Diver cannot communicate with surface, or surface cannot hear diver.\nResponse framework:\nSurface attempts to re-establish communication If no response, initiate emergency procedures Standby diver may be deployed to locate and assist Emergency ascent procedures activated if necessary Responsibility: Supervisor initiates response; standby diver executes if deployed.\nGas Supply Failure What happens: Primary gas supply interrupted or contaminated.\nResponse framework:\nDiver switches to bailout cylinder Surface attempts to restore primary supply If restoration fails, initiate emergency ascent Standby diver may be deployed to assist Responsibility: Diver executes immediate bailout; surface supports recovery.\nUmbilical Entanglement What happens: Umbilical becomes entangled in structure or equipment.\nResponse framework:\nDiver attempts to clear entanglement Surface provides guidance and support If unable to clear, standby diver may be deployed Emergency procedures activated if diver cannot be freed Responsibility: Diver attempts self-rescue first; surface coordinates response.\nOperational Limits Surface-supplied diving has practical limits:\nDepth limits — Typically 50-60m on air, deeper with mixed gas (subject to gas mix and decompression requirements) Bottom time — Limited by decompression requirements and gas supply Work complexity — Constrained by umbilical management and communication requirements Environmental conditions — Current, visibility, and sea state affect operational feasibility What can go wrong: Operations planned beyond practical limits, environmental conditions worse than anticipated, equipment limitations not recognized. Dive planning must account for these limits.\nData \u0026amp; Records Surface-supplied diving operations generate records:\nDive logs — Depth, time, gas consumption, work performed Communication records — Voice logs (if recorded) Equipment records — Maintenance, inspection, and failure records Incident reports — Documentation of anomalies, near-misses, or incidents Audit-worthiness: Records must be traceable, timestamped, and suitable for regulatory review.

This page covers why timestamp integrity matters and how to ensure timestamps are accurate, synchronized, and tamper-resistant.\nWhy This Exists Timestamps enable:\nTemporal ordering — Understanding the sequence of events Incident reconstruction — Reconstructing what happened when Regulatory compliance — Demonstrating compliance with time-based requirements Legal defense — Defending operations with accurate timelines What can go wrong: Inaccurate timestamps, unsynchronized timestamps, tampered timestamps. Each failure mode creates legal and operational risk.\nWho This Is For System engineers designing timestamp systems Operations personnel recording timestamps Incident investigators reconstructing timelines Auditors verifying timestamp accuracy Legal counsel defending operations Timestamp Requirements Accuracy Timestamps must be accurate:\nClock accuracy — System clocks must be accurate Clock synchronization — Clocks must be synchronized across systems Timezone handling — Timezones must be handled correctly Leap second handling — Leap seconds must be handled correctly Operational reality: Clock accuracy degrades over time. Clocks must be regularly synchronized.\nSynchronization Timestamps must be synchronized:\nAcross systems — Timestamps from different systems must be synchronized With reference time — Timestamps must be synchronized with reference time (UTC) Synchronization method — Method of synchronization must be documented Synchronization accuracy — Synchronization accuracy must be known What can go wrong: Systems not synchronized, synchronization lost, synchronization method not documented. Unsynchronized timestamps create confusion and legal risk.\nTamper Resistance Timestamps must be tamper-resistant:\nImmutable records — Timestamp records must be immutable Cryptographic verification — Timestamps must be cryptographically verifiable Access control — Timestamp systems must be access-controlled Audit logging — Access to timestamp systems must be logged Legal requirement: Tampered timestamps are not credible in legal proceedings. Timestamps must be tamper-resistant.\nImplementation Approaches Network Time Protocol (NTP) NTP for clock synchronization:\nNTP servers — Synchronize with NTP servers Stratum levels — Understand NTP stratum levels Accuracy — NTP provides millisecond accuracy typically Reliability — NTP requires network connectivity Operational reality: NTP is standard for network-connected systems. Accuracy depends on network conditions and NTP server quality.\nGPS Time GPS for precise time:\nGPS receivers — GPS receivers provide precise time Accuracy — GPS provides microsecond accuracy Reliability — GPS requires satellite visibility Independence — GPS is independent of network Operational reality: GPS is standard for systems requiring precise time. GPS requires satellite visibility, which may not be available underwater.\nHardware Timestamps Hardware-based timestamps:\nHardware clocks — Hardware clocks with battery backup Accuracy — Hardware clocks maintain accuracy when powered Independence — Hardware clocks are independent of software Limitations — Hardware clocks drift over time Operational reality: Hardware clocks provide backup when network time is unavailable, but require regular synchronization.\nTimestamp Formats ISO 8601 ISO 8601 standard format:\nFormat — YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ Timezone — UTC indicated by \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo;, or timezone offset Precision — Can include fractional seconds Standard — International standard, widely supported Operational reality: ISO 8601 is recommended for interoperability. Most systems support ISO 8601.\nUnix Timestamp Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch):\nFormat — Integer seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC Precision — Second precision (or fractional with extensions) Simplicity — Simple integer format Limitations — Year 2038 problem (32-bit), no timezone information Operational reality: Unix timestamps are common but have limitations. Use 64-bit timestamps to avoid year 2038 problem.\nTimestamp Uncertainty Clock Drift Clocks drift over time:\nDrift rate — Clocks drift at different rates Temperature effects — Temperature affects clock drift Aging effects — Clock accuracy degrades with age Compensation — Drift can be compensated with synchronization Operational reality: Clock drift is inevitable. Regular synchronization compensates for drift.\nSynchronization Uncertainty Synchronization has uncertainty:\nNetwork latency — Network latency affects synchronization accuracy Reference uncertainty — Reference time has uncertainty Synchronization method — Method affects accuracy Measurement — Uncertainty can be measured What can go wrong: Synchronization uncertainty not known, uncertainty not documented. Uncertainty must be quantified and documented.\nTimestamp Verification Post-Facto Verification Verify timestamps after the fact:\nClock logs — Review clock synchronization logs Cross-reference — Cross-reference timestamps from different systems Anomaly detection — Detect timestamp anomalies Validation — Validate timestamps are reasonable Audit requirement: Timestamps must be verifiable. Verification enables audit and legal defense.\nCryptographic Verification Cryptographically verify timestamps:\nDigital signatures — Sign timestamps with digital signatures Hash chains — Use hash chains for timestamp sequences Blockchain — Use blockchain for immutable timestamps (if applicable) Trust anchors — Establish trust anchors for verification Legal requirement: Cryptographic verification provides strong evidence of timestamp integrity. Tampered timestamps cannot be verified.\nOperational Considerations Timestamp Recording Record timestamps correctly:\nAt creation — Record timestamp when data is created Not on access — Do not update timestamp on access Immutable — Timestamps must be immutable once recorded Documented — Timestamp recording must be documented What can go wrong: Timestamps recorded incorrectly, timestamps updated, timestamps not documented. Timestamp recording must be correct and documented.\nTimestamp Display Display timestamps correctly:\nFormat — Display in consistent, readable format Timezone — Display timezone clearly Precision — Display appropriate precision Uncertainty — Display uncertainty if significant Operational reality: Timestamp display affects usability. Display must be clear and consistent.\nRelated Topics Data Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody Audit Logs \u0026amp; Immutability Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/ocean-data/timestamps/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timestamp-integrity\"\u003eTimestamp Integrity\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimestamps are fundamental to operational records, incident investigation, and audit.

Table 9-6 may only be used when the maximum altitude achieved is 10,000 feet or less. For ascents above 10,000 feet, consult NAVSEA 00C for guidance. The cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is maintained at a constant value regardless of the actual altitude of the flight. Though cabin pressure varies somewhat with aircraft type, the nominal value is 8,000 feet. For commercial flights, use a final altitude of 8,000 feet to compute the required surface interval before flying. No surface interval is required before taking a commercial flight if the dive site is at 8,000 feet or higher. In this case, flying results in an increase in atmospheric pressure rather than a decrease. For ascent to altitude following a non-saturation helium-oxygen dive, wait 12 hours if the dive was a no-decompression dive. Wait 24 hours if the dive was a decompression dive. Table 9-7.

Equivalent Air Depth Table Purpose: For Decompression Table Selection Only. EAD values are rounded to the next greater standard depth.\nLegend:\nRegular values = Within 1.4 ata normal working limit Values with (max min) = Exceeds 1.4 ata normal working limit. Requires Commanding Officer\u0026rsquo;s authorization and surface-supplied equipment. Repetitive dives not authorized. Maximum allowable exposure time shown in parentheses. Blank cells = Depth exceeds safe limits of NITROX diving Notes:\nDepths not listed are considered beyond the safe limits of NITROX diving. The EAD, 1.4 ata Normal Working Limit Line and Maximum Allowable Exposure Time for dives deeper than the Normal Working Limit Line are calculated assuming the diver rounds the oxygen percentage in the gas mixture using the standard rounding rule discussed in paragraph 10-4.1.

Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 60 FSW on air is 63 minutes (Group A diver). With residual nitrogen from previous dives, use Table 9-8 to calculate adjusted bottom time.\nWhat is the no-decompression limit at 100 feet? Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 100 FSW on air is 25 minutes (Group A diver). Decompression stops are required beyond this time.\nHow do I calculate a repetitive dive? Find your post-dive repetitive group from Table 9-7 (depth + bottom time) Use Table 9-8 Part 1 (previous group + surface interval) → new group Use Table 9-8 Part 2 (new group + next dive depth) → Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT) Add RNT to planned bottom time → Equivalent Single Dive Time (ESDT) If ESDT \u0026gt; NDL, use Table 9-9 for decompression schedule Use the interactive tool above to perform steps 1–4 automatically.\nWhat is the source of these tables?

These tables are the authoritative standard for U.S. Navy diving operations and are widely used in commercial diving operations worldwide.\nWhy This Exists The U.S. Navy dive tables are the foundation of decompression planning for air and mixed-gas diving operations. They provide:\nNo-decompression limits — Maximum bottom times at various depths without required decompression stops Decompression schedules — Required stops, times, and gas switches for decompression dives Repetitive dive procedures — Surface interval credits and residual nitrogen/helium times Altitude considerations — Procedures for diving at altitude or ascending to altitude after diving Mixed gas procedures — Helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression tables for deeper operations Operational reality: These tables are used by dive supervisors, commercial divers, and operational personnel worldwide. They must be used correctly and verified against the original publication.\nWho This Is For Dive supervisors planning and overseeing diving operations Commercial divers executing dives requiring decompression Safety officers reviewing dive plans and procedures Training personnel teaching decompression procedures Operational planners developing dive procedures and standards Critical Safety Requirements Before using these tables operationally:\nVerify against original publication — Cross-reference all values with the official NAVSEA publication (SS521-AG-PRO-010) Proper training required — Users must be trained in decompression table procedures Medical clearance — Divers must be medically cleared for diving operations Equipment verification — All diving equipment must be verified and functional Supervisor oversight — All decompression dives require qualified supervisor oversight What can go wrong: Incorrect table use, transcription errors, missing updates, improper application. Each failure mode can result in decompression sickness, injury, or death.\nTable Categories USN Air Dive Tables Complete air decompression tables including an interactive NDL lookup tool:\nTable 9-5 — Repetitive Groups Associated with Initial Ascent to Altitude Table 9-6 — Required Surface Interval Before Ascent to Altitude After Diving Table 9-7 — No-Decompression Limits and Repetitive Group Designators (10–190 FSW) Table 9-8 — Residual Nitrogen Time Table for Repetitive Air Dives Table 9-9 — Air Decompression Table (descent 75 FPM, ascent 30 FPM) The air tables page includes an interactive lookup tool for Tables 9-7 and 9-8 — enter depth and bottom time to instantly determine NDL status, repetitive group, and residual nitrogen time for repetitive dives.\nUSN Helium-Oxygen Dive Tables Complete helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression tables including:\nTable 12-4 — Surface-Supplied HeO2 Decompression Table (60–380+ FSW) Descent rate: 75 FPM | Ascent rate: 30 FPM Mandatory gas switches: HeO2 bottom mix → 50% O2 at 40 FSW → 100% O2 at 30 and 20 FSW MK 16 MOD 1 UBA tables — Closed-circuit rebreather procedures for various oxygen partial pressures Mixed gas procedures — Gas switching procedures and chamber oxygen requirements Source Information Official Source: SS521-AG-PRO-010, U.S. Navy Diving Manual, Revision 7, 01 December 2016 Publisher: Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Publication Authority: Published by Direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command\nOperational Use Before operational use:\nObtain official publication — Secure the official NAVSEA publication Verify all values — Cross-check all table values against the official publication Training verification — Ensure all personnel are properly trained Medical clearance — Verify all divers are medically cleared Equipment check — Verify all equipment is functional and calibrated Supervisor approval — Obtain qualified supervisor approval for all dives Responsibility: The dive supervisor is responsible for ensuring correct table use. Incorrect application can result in serious injury or death.\nFrequently Asked Questions What are the U.S. Navy dive tables used for? The USN dive tables are the primary reference for decompression planning in air and mixed-gas diving. They determine the maximum no-decompression bottom time at any depth, the repetitive group accumulated after surfacing, the required surface interval before a second dive, the residual nitrogen time to add to a repetitive dive, and the full decompression schedule (stops, times, gas) when decompression is required.\nWhat edition is current? Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016) is the current edition. Always confirm you are using Revision 7 and obtain the official NAVSEA publication before operational use.\nWhere is the interactive lookup tool? The USN Air Dive Tables page includes a JavaScript-powered NDL lookup tool for Tables 9-7 and 9-8. Enter depth and bottom time for instant NDL and repetitive group lookup, and enter your surface interval for repetitive dive RNT calculations.\nRelated Topics Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Emergency Response Frameworks Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/commercial-diving/usn-dive-tables/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"usn-dive-tables\"\u003eUSN Dive Tables\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCRITICAL WARNING:\u003c/strong\u003e These tables are transcribed from the official U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016). \u003cstrong\u003eThey must be verified against the original NAVSEA publication before operational use.\u003c/strong\u003e Transcription errors, however unlikely, could be fatal.

Air causes nitrogen narcosis at depths beyond ~100 FSW (individual variation), which impairs diver judgment and performance. Helium does not cause narcosis, making HeO2 the preferred gas for deep operations. HeO2 also has faster decompression kinetics than air at equivalent depths due to helium\u0026rsquo;s lower solubility.\nWhat are the gas switch requirements? USN Table 12-4 mandates specific gas switches during ascent:\nBottom mix (HeO2) — all bottom time and stops at 50 FSW and deeper 50% O2 — stop at 40 FSW 100% O2 — stops at 30 and 20 FSW These switches are non-optional and dramatically reduce total decompression time.\nWhat does \u0026ldquo;Chamber O2 Periods\u0026rdquo; mean? Each chamber O2 period is 30 minutes of 100% oxygen breathing in a deck recompression chamber (DRC) after surfacing. This surface decompression (SurDO2) completes the decompression obligation started in the water. The number of periods required increases with bottom time and depth.\nRelated Topics USN Air Dive Tables — Air decompression tables with interactive NDL lookup USN Dive Tables Overview — Complete index of all USN tables Surface-Supplied Diving Systems Dive Planning \u0026amp; Risk Assessment Emergency Response Frameworks ","permalink":"/commercial-diving/usn-heo2-dive-tables/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"us-navy-diving-manual--revision-7-heo2-and-mixed-gas-dive-tables\"\u003eU.S. Navy Diving Manual — Revision 7 HeO2 and Mixed Gas Dive Tables\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSource:\u003c/strong\u003e SS521-AG-PRO-010, U.S. Navy Diving Manual, Revision 7, 01 December 2016\n\u003cstrong\u003eNAVSEA Reference:\u003c/strong\u003e Published by Direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCRITICAL WARNING:\u003c/strong\u003e These tables are transcribed from the official USN Diving Manual Revision 7. \u003cstrong\u003eThey must be verified against the original publication before operational use.\u003c/strong\u003e Transcription errors, however unlikely, could be fatal.

This page explains why auditability is the critical requirement for trusted autonomous operations.\nWhy This Exists Autonomous systems can operate without human oversight, but this creates a trust problem. How do we know what the system did? Why did it make certain decisions? What went wrong when something fails? Auditability answers these questions and enables trust in autonomous systems.\nWho This Is For System architects designing autonomous systems Regulators reviewing autonomous operations Operators deploying autonomous systems Auditors verifying autonomous operations Incident investigators reconstructing autonomous system behavior The Autonomy-Auditability Tradeoff Raw Autonomy Raw autonomy focuses on:\nCapability — What can the system do? Performance — How well does it perform? Independence — How independently can it operate? Operational reality: Raw autonomy is necessary but not sufficient. A system that can operate autonomously but cannot be audited is not trustworthy.\nAuditability Auditability focuses on:\nObservability — Can we observe what the system is doing? Explainability — Can we explain why the system made decisions? Traceability — Can we trace system behavior to causes? Verifiability — Can we verify system behavior after the fact? Operational reality: Auditability enables trust. Without auditability, autonomous systems cannot be trusted for critical operations.\nWhy Auditability Matters Regulatory Compliance Regulators require auditability:\nIncident investigation — Regulators must be able to investigate incidents Compliance verification — Regulators must be able to verify compliance Accountability — Someone must be accountable for autonomous system behavior Legal requirement: Autonomous systems must be auditable for regulatory compliance. Non-auditable systems may not be permitted.\nInsurance Underwriting Insurers require auditability:\nRisk assessment — Insurers must assess risk of autonomous operations Claims investigation — Insurers must investigate claims Loss prevention — Insurers must understand what went wrong Operational reality: Insurers may not cover non-auditable autonomous systems, or may charge higher premiums.\nIncident Investigation Incident investigation requires auditability:\nWhat happened — Investigators must understand what happened Why it happened — Investigators must understand why it happened How to prevent — Investigators must understand how to prevent recurrence What can go wrong: Non-auditable systems make incident investigation impossible. This creates legal and operational risk.\nOperational Trust Operators require auditability:\nDecision confidence — Operators must trust autonomous system decisions Failure understanding — Operators must understand failures Continuous improvement — Operators must improve systems based on audit data Operational reality: Operators will not trust non-auditable autonomous systems for critical operations.\nAuditability Requirements Observability System must be observable:\nState visibility — Can we see system state? Decision visibility — Can we see system decisions? Action visibility — Can we see system actions? Sensor visibility — Can we see sensor data? What can go wrong: System not observable, critical information not logged, logs not accessible. Observability must be designed in.\nExplainability System must be explainable:\nDecision explanation — Can we explain why decisions were made? Action explanation — Can we explain why actions were taken? Failure explanation — Can we explain why failures occurred? Operational reality: Explainability is difficult for complex systems (e.g., neural networks), but essential for trust.\nTraceability System must be traceable:\nData traceability — Can we trace data to source? Decision traceability — Can we trace decisions to inputs? Action traceability — Can we trace actions to decisions? Audit requirement: Traceability enables auditors to verify system behavior and identify causes.\nVerifiability System must be verifiable:\nPost-facto verification — Can we verify behavior after the fact? Independent verification — Can independent parties verify behavior? Cryptographic verification — Can we cryptographically verify records? Legal requirement: Verifiability enables legal defense and regulatory compliance.\nAuditability vs. Performance The Tradeoff There is often a tradeoff between auditability and performance:\nLogging overhead — Logging adds computational and storage overhead Explanation complexity — Explanation may require additional computation Design constraints — Auditability may constrain system design Operational reality: Tradeoffs must be made, but auditability should not be sacrificed for performance in critical systems.\nThe Solution Design for auditability from the start:\nBuilt-in logging — Logging designed into system architecture Efficient logging — Efficient logging to minimize overhead Selective logging — Log what matters, not everything Compression — Compress logs to reduce storage What can go wrong: Auditability added as afterthought, logging too expensive, logging incomplete. Auditability must be designed in.\nImplementation Approaches Comprehensive Logging Log everything:\nSystem state — Log all system state changes Decisions — Log all decisions and reasoning Actions — Log all actions taken Sensor data — Log all sensor data Advantages: Complete audit trail, no gaps.\nDisadvantages: High storage and computational overhead, difficult to analyze.\nSelective Logging Log what matters:\nCritical decisions — Log critical decisions and reasoning State changes — Log significant state changes Anomalies — Log anomalies and exceptions Periodic snapshots — Periodic full state snapshots Advantages: Lower overhead, easier to analyze.\nDisadvantages: May miss important information, gaps in audit trail.\nEvent Sourcing Log events, reconstruct state:\nEvent log — Log all events that change state State reconstruction — Reconstruct state from event log Immutable log — Event log is immutable Advantages: Complete audit trail, state reconstruction, time travel.\nDisadvantages: Requires event sourcing architecture, may be complex.\nRelated Topics Data Provenance \u0026amp; Chain-of-Custody Audit Logs \u0026amp; Immutability Dive Logs \u0026amp; Operational Records ","permalink":"/open-standards/auditability/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-auditability-matters-more-than-raw-autonomy\"\u003eWhy Auditability Matters More Than Raw Autonomy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs subsea systems become more autonomous, the ability to audit what happened becomes more important than the raw capability to operate autonomously.
