# Swarm & Networked Systems

This section covers multi-vehicle coordination, communication systems, and operational frameworks for networked subsea operations. As operations scale to multiple vehicles, coordination and communication become critical.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Multi-vehicle coordination** — Concepts and frameworks for coordinating multiple vehicles
- **Acoustic vs RF vs hybrid comms** — Communication options and tradeoffs
- **Latency, bandwidth, and reliability** — Communication performance characteristics
- **Graceful degradation** — How systems degrade when communication is lost
- **Loss-of-comms behavior** — What vehicles do when communication fails

## Key Principles

1. **Communication is unreliable** — Subsea communication is inherently unreliable; systems must be designed accordingly
2. **Latency matters** — Communication latency affects coordination capability
3. **Degradation is inevitable** — Systems will lose communication; they must degrade gracefully
4. **Autonomy enables coordination** — Vehicles must be able to operate autonomously to enable coordination
