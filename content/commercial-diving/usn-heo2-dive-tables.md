q = 'What is the USN helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression table?'
a = 'Table 12-4 of the U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 is the Surface-Supplied Helium-Oxygen Decompression Table. It covers depths from 60 to over 380 FSW with a descent rate of 75 FPM and ascent rate of 30 FPM. Decompression uses the bottom helium-oxygen mix at 50 FSW and deeper, switches to 50% O2 at 40 FSW, and uses 100% O2 at 30 and 20 FSW stops.'

[[faq]]
q = 'Why is helium-oxygen (HeO2) used instead of air for deep diving?'
a = 'Helium-oxygen mixtures are used for diving deeper than approximately 150-200 FSW because helium does not cause nitrogen narcosis, allows faster ascent and shorter decompression times compared to air at equivalent depths, and avoids high-pressure nervous syndrome better than air at extreme depths. HeO2 is the standard breathing gas for deep surface-supplied commercial diving operations.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What are the gas switches in USN HeO2 decompression?'
a = 'USN Table 12-4 specifies three gas phases during decompression: (1) Bottom Mix (HeO2) for all stops at 50 FSW and deeper; (2) Switch to 50% O2 at the 40 FSW stop; (3) Switch to 100% O2 at the 30 FSW and 20 FSW stops. These gas switches are mandatory — they accelerate decompression and reduce inert gas loading.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the maximum depth covered by USN HeO2 tables?'
a = 'USN Table 12-4 explicitly covers surface-supplied helium-oxygen diving to depths beyond 380 FSW, with exceptional exposure procedures for deep dives. The table provides decompression schedules for standard and exceptional exposure dives, with bottom times at each depth section clearly showing where Commanding Officer authorization is required for exceptional exposures.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the MK 16 MOD 1 UBA and how do its tables differ?'
a = 'The MK 16 MOD 1 UBA (Underwater Breathing Apparatus) is a closed-circuit rebreather used by U.S. Navy divers. Its decompression tables differ from open-circuit surface-supplied tables because the rebreather maintains a constant partial pressure of oxygen (PPO2) throughout the dive, which changes the decompression obligation compared to open-circuit breathing. The MK 16 tables specify procedures for different PPO2 setpoints and depth ranges.'

[[faq]]
q = 'How does surface decompression work with HeO2 diving?'
a = 'Surface decompression (SurDO2) with HeO2 involves ascending from the last in-water stop, transferring the diver to a deck recompression chamber, and completing the remaining decompression obligation breathing 100% oxygen under pressure. The "Chamber O2 Periods" column in Table 12-4 specifies the number of 30-minute oxygen breathing periods required in the chamber after surfacing.'

## About These Tables

These tables apply to helium-oxygen (HeO2) and mixed gas diving using surface-supplied equipment (SSDS) and the MK 16 MOD 1 closed-circuit UBA. HeO2 is the standard breathing gas for deep commercial and naval diving operations where nitrogen narcosis and extended air decompression would be limiting factors.

**Key differences from air tables:**
- No nitrogen narcosis at depth (helium is narcosis-free)
- Faster uptake and elimination kinetics than nitrogen
- Gas switches during decompression (HeO2 → 50% O2 → 100% O2) dramatically shorten decompression time
- Chamber oxygen periods required post-dive
- Commanding Officer authorization required for exceptional exposure bottom times

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why use helium-oxygen instead of air at depth?

Air causes nitrogen narcosis at depths beyond ~100 FSW (individual variation), which impairs diver judgment and performance. Helium does not cause narcosis, making HeO2 the preferred gas for deep operations. HeO2 also has faster decompression kinetics than air at equivalent depths due to helium's lower solubility.

### What are the gas switch requirements?

USN Table 12-4 mandates specific gas switches during ascent:
1. **Bottom mix (HeO2)** — all bottom time and stops at 50 FSW and deeper
2. **50% O2** — stop at 40 FSW
3. **100% O2** — stops at 30 and 20 FSW

These switches are non-optional and dramatically reduce total decompression time.

### What does "Chamber O2 Periods" mean?

Each chamber O2 period is 30 minutes of 100% oxygen breathing in a deck recompression chamber (DRC) after surfacing. This surface decompression (SurDO2) completes the decompression obligation started in the water. The number of periods required increases with bottom time and depth.
