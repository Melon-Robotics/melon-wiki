# Commercial Diving Operations

This section covers operational procedures, planning frameworks, and safety considerations for commercial diving operations. Content is written for divers, supervisors, and operational personnel who need to understand how diving operations work in practice.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Surface-supplied diving** — Equipment, procedures, and operational considerations
- **Saturation diving** — Overview of systems and operational frameworks (not medical instruction)
- **Dive planning & execution** — Pre-dive planning, risk assessment, and operational execution
- **Decompression theory** — High-level concepts and operational implications (non-medical)
- **Emergency procedures** — Frameworks and response structures (not step-by-step rescue)
- **Human factors & fatigue** — Operational considerations for diver performance
- **Dive logs & records** — Traceability, auditability, and operational documentation

## What This Section Is Not

- **Medical instruction** — We do not provide medical advice, treatment protocols, or detailed decompression schedules
- **Rescue procedures** — We document frameworks and response structures, not step-by-step rescue instructions
- **Training materials** — While useful for training, this is reference documentation, not a training curriculum

## Key Principles

1. **Operational reality** — Procedures reflect how diving actually works offshore, not idealized scenarios
2. **Audit-worthiness** — All procedures are documented in a way suitable for regulatory review
3. **Failure modes** — We explicitly document what can go wrong and how operations degrade
4. **Responsibility boundaries** — Clear delineation of who is responsible for what
