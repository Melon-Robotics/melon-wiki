[[faq]]
q = 'What is the no-decompression limit at 60 feet for air diving?'
a = 'Per USN Table 9-7, the no-decompression limit (NDL) at 60 FSW on air is 63 minutes. This assumes the diver starts as Group A (no residual nitrogen from prior dives within the repetitive interval). With residual nitrogen loading from a previous dive, the adjusted bottom time will be less — use Table 9-8 to calculate the Residual Nitrogen Time and Equivalent Single Dive Time. Always verify against the official U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010).'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the no-decompression limit at 100 feet for air diving?'
a = 'Per USN Table 9-7, the no-decompression limit (NDL) at 100 FSW on air is 25 minutes for a diver with no prior repetitive dives (Group A). At depths of 100 FSW and greater, bottom times are short and decompression planning is critical. Exceeding the NDL requires decompression stops per Table 9-9 (Air Decompression Table).'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the no-decompression limit at 40 feet for air diving?'
a = 'Per USN Table 9-7, the no-decompression limit at 40 FSW on air is 163 minutes for a Group A diver. The maximum achievable repetitive group at 40 FSW is Group O. For bottom times beyond 163 minutes, decompression stops are required per Table 9-9.'

[[faq]]
q = 'How do repetitive dive groups work in the USN air tables?'
a = 'After surfacing, divers are assigned a repetitive group (A through Z) from Table 9-7 based on depth and bottom time — A is lowest nitrogen loading, Z is highest. Before the next dive, use Table 9-8 Part 1 with your post-dive group and surface interval to find your new group. Then use Table 9-8 Part 2 to find your Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT) at the next planned depth. Add RNT to planned bottom time to get the Equivalent Single Dive Time (ESDT), then use Table 9-9 for the appropriate decompression schedule if the ESDT exceeds the NDL.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is a repetitive group designator in diving?'
a = "A repetitive group designator is a letter (A through Z) from the USN dive tables representing the amount of residual nitrogen dissolved in a diver's tissues after surfacing. Group A indicates the lowest nitrogen loading; Group Z indicates the highest. The designator is determined from Table 9-7 based on depth and bottom time, and is used to calculate safe bottom times for subsequent dives within the repetitive interval (typically 12 hours for air diving)."

[[faq]]
q = 'Can commercial divers use US Navy dive tables?'
a = 'Yes. USN air dive tables are widely used in commercial diving and are accepted by IMCA, ADCI, and many national regulatory bodies as valid decompression procedures for surface-supplied air diving. Always use the current official edition — Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, NAVSEA, December 2016) — and ensure all personnel are properly trained in their application. Never rely on transcribed tables for operational use without verifying against the original publication.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is USN Table 9-7 and what does it show?'
a = 'Table 9-7 of the U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 is titled "No-Decompression Limits and Repetitive Group Designators for No-Decompression Air Dives." For standard depths from 10 to 190 FSW, it lists the maximum no-decompression bottom time and the repetitive group letter (A–Z) accumulated at specific bottom times. It is the primary planning reference for no-decompression air dives in both naval and commercial diving operations.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What does it mean when a depth shows unlimited NDL in the USN tables?'
a = 'At shallow depths (10, 15, and 20 FSW), the USN tables show an "Unlimited" no-decompression limit. This means that no decompression stops are required regardless of bottom time at that depth alone. However, repetitive group nitrogen loading still accumulates — at 20 FSW, Group K is the maximum achievable group marked with an asterisk (*). Divers must still account for repetitive group loading when planning subsequent dives.'

## Table 9-5. Repetitive Groups Associated with Initial Ascent to Altitude

| Altitude (feet) | Repetitive Group |
|---|---|
| 1,000 | A |
| 2,000 | A |
| 3,000 | B |
| 4,000 | C |
| 5,000 | D |
| 6,000 | E |
| 7,000 | F |
| 8,000 | G |
| 9,000 | H |
| 10,000 | I |

> **WARNING:** Altitudes above 10,000 feet can impose serious stress on the body resulting in significant medical problems while the acclimatization process takes place. Ascents to these altitudes must be slow to allow acclimatization to occur and prophylactic drugs may be required to prevent the occurrence of altitude sickness. These exposures should always be planned in consultation with a Diving Medical Officer. Commands conducting diving operations above 10,000 feet may obtain the appropriate decompression procedures from NAVSEA 00C.

| Exceptional Exposure | Wait 48 hours before ascent |||||||||||

**Notes:**
1. When using Table 9-6, use the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the previous 24-hour period.
2. Table 9-6 may only be used when the maximum altitude achieved is 10,000 feet or less. For ascents above 10,000 feet, consult NAVSEA 00C for guidance.
3. The cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is maintained at a constant value regardless of the actual altitude of the flight. Though cabin pressure varies somewhat with aircraft type, the nominal value is 8,000 feet. For commercial flights, use a final altitude of 8,000 feet to compute the required surface interval before flying.
4. No surface interval is required before taking a commercial flight if the dive site is at 8,000 feet or higher. In this case, flying results in an increase in atmospheric pressure rather than a decrease.
5. For ascent to altitude following a non-saturation helium-oxygen dive, wait 12 hours if the dive was a no-decompression dive. Wait 24 hours if the dive was a decompression dive.

## Table 9-8. Residual Nitrogen Time Table for Repetitive Air Dives

This table has two parts:
1. **Surface Interval Credit Table** — Determines new repetitive group after a surface interval
2. **Residual Nitrogen Times** — Minutes of residual nitrogen time for the repetitive dive

### Part 1: Surface Interval Credit Table

Locate your previous repetitive group designation. Read horizontally to find the column where your surface interval falls. Read down to find your new repetitive group.

**\*** = Dives following surface intervals longer than this are not repetitive dives. Use actual bottom times in the Air Decompression Tables.

All times in h:mm format.

## Table 9-9. Air Decompression Table

**(DESCENT RATE 75 FPM — ASCENT RATE 30 FPM)**

Stop times (min) include travel time, except first air and first O2 stop.
Each depth section shows AIR decompression and AIR/O2 decompression schedules.

**Exposure Categories:**
- Entries before any marker line = **Normal Exposure (No Decompression)**
- **SurDO2 Rec** = In-Water Air/O2 Decompression or Surface Decompression Using Oxygen Recommended
- **EE: Air / O2 Req** = Exceptional Exposure: In-Water Air Decompression — In-Water Air/O2 Decompression or SurDO2 Required
- **EE: O2 Req** = Exceptional Exposure: In-Water Air/O2 Decompression — SurDO2 Required
- **EE: SurDO2** = Exceptional Exposure: SurDO2 Required

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the no-decompression limit at 60 feet for air diving?

Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 60 FSW on air is **63 minutes** (Group A diver). With residual nitrogen from previous dives, use Table 9-8 to calculate adjusted bottom time.

### What is the no-decompression limit at 100 feet?

Per USN Table 9-7, the NDL at 100 FSW on air is **25 minutes** (Group A diver). Decompression stops are required beyond this time.

### How do I calculate a repetitive dive?

1. Find your post-dive repetitive group from Table 9-7 (depth + bottom time)
2. Use Table 9-8 Part 1 (previous group + surface interval) → new group
3. Use Table 9-8 Part 2 (new group + next dive depth) → Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT)
4. Add RNT to planned bottom time → Equivalent Single Dive Time (ESDT)
5. If ESDT > NDL, use Table 9-9 for decompression schedule

Use the interactive tool above to perform steps 1–4 automatically.
