# Dive Logs & Operational Records

Dive logs and operational records provide traceability and auditability for commercial diving operations. This page covers what must be recorded, how records must be maintained, and why this matters for regulatory compliance and incident investigation.

## Why This Exists

Operational records serve multiple purposes:

- **Regulatory compliance** — Required by IMCA, ADCI, and national regulations
- **Incident investigation** — Essential for understanding what happened and why
- **Insurance claims** — Required documentation for insurance coverage
- **Operational improvement** — Historical data informs future planning
- **Legal defense** — Proper records protect operators in disputes

**What can go wrong:** Incomplete records, lost records, altered records, untraceable records. Each failure mode creates legal and operational risk.

## Who This Is For

- Dive supervisors maintaining records
- Safety officers auditing record-keeping
- Regulators reviewing compliance
- Incident investigators reconstructing events
- Insurance underwriters assessing risk
- Legal counsel defending operations

## Required Records

### Dive Log Entries

Each dive must be logged with:

- **Date and time** — Start time, bottom time, surface time, completion time
- **Location** — Geographic coordinates, water depth, structure/work site
- **Diver information** — Diver name, certification level, experience
- **Depth profile** — Maximum depth, depth vs. time profile
- **Gas information** — Gas mix, consumption, pressure readings
- **Decompression** — Decompression schedule, stops completed, deviations
- **Work performed** — Tasks completed, equipment used, issues encountered
- **Environmental conditions** — Current, visibility, sea state, temperature
- **Team composition** — Supervisor, standby diver, support personnel
- **Equipment** — Equipment used, equipment issues, maintenance performed

**Traceability:** Each entry must be timestamped and attributable to a specific person. Records must be immutable once created.

### Equipment Records

Equipment must be tracked:

- **Inspection records** — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance
- **Calibration records** — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment
- **Maintenance records** — Repairs, replacements, modifications
- **Failure records** — Equipment failures, near-misses, incidents

**Audit-worthiness:** Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.

### Training Records

Personnel qualifications must be documented:

- **Certifications** — Diver certifications, supervisor qualifications, medical fitness
- **Training** — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training
- **Experience** — Dive history, hours logged, types of work performed

**Responsibility:** Operator maintains training records. Auditors verify that personnel are qualified for assigned roles.

### Incident Reports

Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:

- **Incident description** — What happened, when, where, who was involved
- **Causal analysis** — Why it happened, contributing factors
- **Response actions** — What was done in response
- **Preventive measures** — What will prevent recurrence

**Legal sensitivity:** Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate.

## Record-Keeping Requirements

### Timeliness

Records must be created:

- **During operations** — Real-time logging of dive parameters
- **Immediately after** — Post-dive debrief and log completion
- **Within 24 hours** — Final log entry and supervisor review

**What can go wrong:** Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly; records must be contemporaneous.

### Accuracy

Records must be accurate:

- **Measured values** — Depth, time, pressure from calibrated instruments
- **Observed values** — Environmental conditions, work performed, issues encountered
- **Attributed values** — Who recorded what, when

**What can go wrong:** Estimation instead of measurement, rounding errors, transcription errors. Accuracy matters for decompression calculations and incident investigation.

### Completeness

Records must be complete:

- **All required fields** — No missing information
- **All dives logged** — No skipped dives
- **All incidents reported** — No unreported incidents

**What can go wrong:** Incomplete records create gaps in operational history. Gaps reduce audit-worthiness and complicate incident investigation.

### Immutability

Records must be immutable once created:

- **No alterations** — Corrections must be documented as amendments, not changes
- **Version control** — Track all changes with timestamps and attribution
- **Audit trail** — Who changed what, when, why

**Legal requirement:** Altered records are not credible in legal proceedings. Immutability is essential for audit-worthiness.

## Data Provenance

Records must demonstrate data provenance:

- **Source** — Where did the data come from? Instrument, observation, calculation?
- **Method** — How was the data obtained? Direct measurement, estimation, calculation?
- **Uncertainty** — What is the uncertainty in the measurement?
- **Chain of custody** — Who handled the data, when, how was it transferred?

**Audit-worthiness:** Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors or fraud.

## Storage & Retention

### Storage Requirements

Records must be stored:

- **Secure storage** — Protected from loss, damage, unauthorized access
- **Backup systems** — Redundant storage to prevent data loss
- **Access control** — Only authorized personnel can access records
- **Format** — Readable format that will remain accessible over time

**What can go wrong:** Lost records, corrupted files, inaccessible formats, unauthorized access. Storage systems must be reliable and secure.

### Retention Requirements

Records must be retained:

- **Regulatory minimums** — IMCA, ADCI, and national regulations specify retention periods
- **Legal requirements** — Statutes of limitation may require longer retention
- **Operational value** — Historical records inform future operations

**Typical retention:** 5-7 years minimum, longer for incidents or legal proceedings. Retention policies must be documented and followed.

## Digital vs. Paper Records

### Digital Records

Advantages:
- **Searchability** — Easy to search and filter
- **Backup** — Easy to create redundant copies
- **Analysis** — Easy to analyze trends and patterns
- **Access** — Easy to share with authorized personnel

Challenges:
- **Format obsolescence** — Formats may become unreadable over time
- **System dependencies** — Requires software and hardware to read
- **Security** — Requires cybersecurity measures
- **Integrity** — Requires cryptographic verification to prevent tampering

### Paper Records

Advantages:
- **Permanence** — Readable without technology
- **Legal acceptance** — Well-established legal precedent
- **Simplicity** — No software dependencies

Challenges:
- **Storage** — Physical space requirements
- **Searchability** — Difficult to search large volumes
- **Backup** — Requires physical copying
- **Damage** — Vulnerable to fire, water, deterioration

**Operational reality:** Most operations use digital records with paper backup for critical documents. Hybrid approaches are common.

## Audit Requirements

Records must support audits:

- **Regulatory audits** — IMCA, ADCI, national regulators
- **Client audits** — Contract compliance verification
- **Insurance audits** — Risk assessment and claims verification
- **Internal audits** — Quality assurance and continuous improvement

**Audit-worthiness:** Records must be complete, accurate, traceable, and immutable. Auditors must be able to verify operational compliance.
