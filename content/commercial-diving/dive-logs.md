[[faq]]
q = 'What must be recorded in a commercial diving log?'
a = 'A commercial diving log must record, at minimum: date and dive start/end times, GPS location and water depth, diver name and certification number, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2/He percentage, decompression schedule used and any deviations, work performed and equipment used, environmental conditions (visibility, current, temperature, sea state), team composition (supervisor, standby diver, tender), and supervisor signature. Equipment inspection records and gas analysis certificates must be retained separately.'

[[faq]]
q = 'How long must commercial diving records be kept?'
a = 'Minimum retention periods vary by jurisdiction. IMCA guidelines recommend retaining dive records for at least 5 years. ADCI Consensus Standards require 5 years for routine operational logs. Records relating to personal injury, decompression sickness treatment, or incident investigation should be retained indefinitely — claims can arise years after an incident. Many operators retain all records for 7-10 years to protect against late claims and to support equipment maintenance tracking.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What makes a diving log audit-worthy?'
a = 'An audit-worthy dive log must be: contemporaneous (recorded during or immediately after the dive — not reconstructed from memory), accurate (measured values from calibrated instruments, not estimates), complete (all required fields filled with no gaps), attributable (signed by the diver and countersigned by the supervisor with printed names), and immutable (corrections documented as dated amendments with reason and signature, not erasures or overwrites). Digital records must have an audit trail showing who created, accessed, or modified each entry.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What are IMCA requirements for commercial dive logs?'
a = 'IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association) requirements for dive logs are primarily defined in IMCA M 103 (Code of Practice for Commercial Diving Operations in the Offshore Oil Industry) and related guidance documents. Key requirements include recording all mandatory dive parameters, supervisor verification and countersignature, equipment inspection and calibration records, gas analysis records, retention for at least 5 years, and the ability to reconstruct the complete dive profile from the log alone. IMCA also publishes standard form templates for diving operations.'

[[faq]]
q = 'Do commercial divers need to log every dive?'
a = 'Yes. All commercial diving operations — including no-decompression bounce dives, standby diver entries, and bell runs — must be logged. There are no exceptions for "routine" or "short" dives. The dive supervisor is responsible for ensuring every water entry is recorded with all required parameters. Missing entries create audit failures and can constitute regulatory violations.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is a dive supervisor required to certify on a dive log?'
a = 'The dive supervisor must certify that: the dive was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, the diving safety manual, and approved procedures; all personnel were medically fit and properly certified; all equipment was inspected and functional; the breathing gas was analyzed and within specification; the decompression schedule was correctly selected and followed; and all information in the log is accurate and complete. This certification is typically a signature and printed name on each dive log entry.'

# Commercial Dive Logs & Operational Records

Dive logs and operational records provide traceability and auditability for commercial diving operations. This page covers what must be recorded, how records must be maintained, and why this matters for regulatory compliance, incident investigation, and legal defense.

## Why This Exists

Operational records serve multiple critical purposes:

- **Regulatory compliance** — Required by IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, and national regulations
- **Incident investigation** — Essential for reconstructing what happened and why
- **Insurance claims** — Required documentation for commercial diving insurance coverage
- **Legal defense** — Proper records protect operators, supervisors, and divers in disputes
- **Operational improvement** — Historical data informs future planning and risk assessment

**What can go wrong:** Incomplete records, lost records, altered records, untraceable records. Each failure mode creates regulatory, legal, and operational risk — including criminal liability for supervisors in some jurisdictions.

## Who This Is For

- Dive supervisors maintaining operational records
- Safety officers auditing record-keeping compliance
- Regulators reviewing diving operations
- Incident investigators reconstructing dive events
- Insurance underwriters assessing operational risk
- Legal counsel defending diving operations

## Required Records

### Dive Log Entries

Each dive must be logged with:

- **Date and time** — Start time, bottom time, surface time, completion time
- **Location** — Geographic coordinates (GPS), water depth at dive site, structure or work site ID
- **Diver information** — Diver name, certification level, certification number, medical clearance expiry
- **Depth profile** — Maximum depth (FSW), time at depth, descent and ascent rates
- **Gas information** — Gas mix specified and analyzed, O2%, He%, CO analysis date, cylinder pressures
- **Decompression** — Table and schedule used, stops completed with depths and times, deviations if any
- **Work performed** — Tasks completed, equipment used, findings, issues encountered
- **Environmental conditions** — Current speed and direction, visibility, sea state, water temperature
- **Team composition** — Supervisor name, standby diver name, tender name, DMO contact
- **Equipment** — Primary and backup equipment used, pre-dive inspection results, equipment issues

**Traceability:** Each entry must be timestamped and attributable to a specific person. Records must be immutable once created — corrections require amendment notes, not erasures.

### Equipment Records

Equipment must be tracked:

- **Inspection records** — Pre-dive and post-dive inspections, periodic maintenance, out-of-service events
- **Calibration records** — Gas analyzers, depth gauges, communication equipment, O2 analyzers
- **Maintenance records** — Repairs, replacements, modifications with part numbers and dates
- **Failure records** — Equipment failures, near-misses, corrective actions taken

**Audit-worthiness:** Equipment records must demonstrate that equipment was maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations and regulatory requirements.

### Training Records

Personnel qualifications must be documented:

- **Certifications** — Diver certifications (ADCI, IMCA, HSE, or equivalent), supervisor qualifications, medical fitness certificates
- **Training history** — Training completed, competency assessments, refresher training, emergency drills
- **Dive history** — Cumulative dive hours, types of operations, specific qualifications (bell diving, saturation, etc.)

### Incident Reports

Incidents, near-misses, and anomalies must be documented:

- **Incident description** — What happened, when, where, who was involved
- **Causal analysis** — Why it happened, contributing factors, root cause
- **Response actions** — What was done in response, immediate and follow-up
- **Preventive measures** — What will prevent recurrence

**Legal sensitivity:** Incident reports may be discoverable in legal proceedings. They must be factual and accurate. Do not speculate or assign blame — describe what happened and what was done.

## Record-Keeping Requirements

### Timeliness

Records must be created:

- **During operations** — Real-time logging of depth, time, and gas data
- **Immediately after** — Post-dive debrief, decompression completion, supervisor countersignature
- **Within 24 hours** — Final log review, incident notification if required

**What can go wrong:** Delayed logging leads to incomplete or inaccurate records. Memory degrades quickly — records must be contemporaneous to be credible in investigation or litigation.

### Accuracy

Records must use measured values, not estimates:

- **Depth** — From calibrated depth gauge, not estimated
- **Time** — From synchronized timepieces, not reconstructed
- **Gas** — Analyzed O2%, not assumed from cylinder label
- **Pressure** — From calibrated gauges, with before/after readings

### Completeness

- All required fields completed — no blank mandatory fields
- All dives logged — no skipped entries regardless of dive duration
- All decompression stops recorded with actual times, not planned times

### Immutability

Records must be immutable once signed:

- **No overwriting** — Errors corrected with a single line strike-through, initialed and dated
- **Amendment process** — Significant corrections require a separate amendment note with reason, date, and signature
- **No backdating** — All entries dated and timed at creation

---

## Data Provenance

Records must demonstrate data provenance:

- **Source** — Where did the data originate? Instrument? Observation? Calculation?
- **Method** — Direct measurement, estimation, or derived value?
- **Chain of custody** — Who recorded the data, who verified it, how was it transferred?

**Audit-worthiness:** Data provenance enables auditors to verify record accuracy and identify potential errors. Records that cannot be traced to a source are not credible.

---

## Storage & Retention

### Storage Requirements

- **Secure storage** — Protected from loss, damage, fire, water, and unauthorized access
- **Backup** — Redundant copies in separate physical locations or cloud storage with access controls
- **Access control** — Only authorized personnel can view or modify records
- **Format** — Readable format that will remain accessible for the full retention period

### Retention Periods

| Record Type | Minimum Retention | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Dive logs (routine) | 5 years | IMCA M 103, ADCI |
| Equipment inspection records | 5 years or equipment life | Manufacturer / regulator |
| Training & certification records | Duration of employment + 5 years | Standard practice |
| Incident reports | Indefinite | Statute of limitations |
| Personal injury records | Indefinite | Legal requirement |
| Gas analysis records | 5 years | Standard practice |

**Operational reality:** Many jurisdictions and contracts require retention beyond these minimums. When in doubt, retain longer.

### Digital vs. Paper Records

**Digital records** — Advantages: searchable, easily backed up, can support audit trails, integrates with decompression software. Challenges: format obsolescence, system dependencies, cybersecurity requirements, integrity verification.

**Paper records** — Advantages: universally readable, legally established, no technology dependency. Challenges: physical storage, difficult to search at scale, backup requires physical copying.

**Best practice:** Dual records (digital primary, paper backup for critical dives) provide the advantages of both. The paper record must be a faithful copy of the digital record, not a summary.

---

## Audit Requirements

Records must support the following audit types:

- **Regulatory audits** — IMCA, ADCI, HSE, OSHA, flag state, coastal state
- **Client audits** — Third-party verification of contract compliance
- **Insurance audits** — Risk assessment and claims verification
- **Internal audits** — Quality assurance and continuous improvement

**What auditors look for:** Complete entries, supervisor signatures, calibration records, training records cross-referenced to personnel, gas analysis certificates, incident report trails. Gaps in any of these create audit findings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What must be in a commercial diving log?

Every commercial dive log entry must include: date and times (start, max depth, surfaced), GPS location, diver identity and certification, maximum depth reached, bottom time, breathing gas mix and analyzed O2%, decompression schedule followed and any deviations, work performed, environmental conditions, and supervisor signature. See the printable template above for a complete field reference.

### How long must records be kept?

Minimum 5 years for routine logs (IMCA/ADCI). Indefinite for incident reports and records involving personal injury. Many operators keep all records for 7-10 years. Check your contract, your jurisdiction, and your insurer's requirements — they may be more stringent.

### What makes a record legally defensible?

Contemporaneous creation (not reconstructed from memory), measured values from calibrated instruments, complete required fields, supervisor countersignature, immutable storage with audit trail. Records that can be shown to have been altered, backdated, or estimated rather than measured are not credible in legal proceedings.
