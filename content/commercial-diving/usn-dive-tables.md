q = 'What are the U.S. Navy dive tables?'
a = 'The U.S. Navy Dive Tables are official decompression procedures published in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual (Revision 7, SS521-AG-PRO-010) by NAVSEA (Naval Sea Systems Command). They provide no-decompression limits, repetitive dive procedures, and full decompression schedules for air diving (Tables 9-5 through 9-9) and helium-oxygen mixed gas diving (Table 12-4). They are the authoritative standard for U.S. Navy diving and are widely accepted by IMCA, ADCI, and commercial diving regulatory bodies worldwide.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is USN Diving Manual Revision 7?'
a = 'The U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010) was published on 01 December 2016 by direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). It is the official reference for all U.S. Navy diving operations and includes the complete decompression tables for air, helium-oxygen, and mixed gas diving. It superseded Revision 6 with updated procedures and table values.'

[[faq]]
q = 'Where can I get the official USN diving manual?'
a = 'The official U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010) is available through the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and authorized U.S. Navy publications channels. Always obtain the official publication and verify all table values against it before operational use. Never rely solely on transcribed or secondary sources for operational diving decisions.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the difference between USN air and HeO2 dive tables?'
a = 'Air dive tables (Tables 9-5 through 9-9) apply to surface-supplied and scuba air diving at depths up to 300 FSW. Helium-oxygen (HeO2) tables (Table 12-4) apply to mixed gas diving using helium-oxygen mixtures, typically for operations deeper than 150-200 FSW where nitrogen narcosis and extended air decompression would be operationally limiting. HeO2 requires mandatory in-water gas switches (to 50% O2 at 40 FSW, then 100% O2 at 30 and 20 FSW) and post-dive chamber oxygen periods.'

[[faq]]
q = 'Are USN dive tables accepted for commercial diving?'
a = 'Yes. USN dive tables are widely accepted in commercial diving operations worldwide. They are recognized by IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association), ADCI (Association of Diving Contractors International), and many national regulatory bodies as valid decompression procedures for surface-supplied diving. Commercial operators must ensure they use the correct revision (Revision 7) and obtain the official NAVSEA publication.'

[[faq]]
q = 'What is the difference between USN Revision 6 and Revision 7?'
a = 'USN Diving Manual Revision 7 (December 2016) superseded Revision 6 with several updates including revised exceptional exposure procedures, updated helium-oxygen table values, and procedural clarifications. When using either revision operationally, always confirm you have the correct edition and that the procedures match the authorized procedures at your organization. When in doubt, use Revision 7 as the current official edition.'

# USN Dive Tables

> **CRITICAL WARNING:** These tables are transcribed from the official U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016). **They must be verified against the original NAVSEA publication before operational use.** Transcription errors, however unlikely, could be fatal. Always cross-reference with the official publication.

This section provides the complete U.S. Navy Diving Manual Revision 7 decompression tables for operational reference. These tables are the authoritative standard for U.S. Navy diving operations and are widely used in commercial diving operations worldwide.

## Why This Exists

The U.S. Navy dive tables are the foundation of decompression planning for air and mixed-gas diving operations. They provide:

- **No-decompression limits** — Maximum bottom times at various depths without required decompression stops
- **Decompression schedules** — Required stops, times, and gas switches for decompression dives
- **Repetitive dive procedures** — Surface interval credits and residual nitrogen/helium times
- **Altitude considerations** — Procedures for diving at altitude or ascending to altitude after diving
- **Mixed gas procedures** — Helium-oxygen (HeO2) decompression tables for deeper operations

**Operational reality:** These tables are used by dive supervisors, commercial divers, and operational personnel worldwide. They must be used correctly and verified against the original publication.

## Who This Is For

- **Dive supervisors** planning and overseeing diving operations
- **Commercial divers** executing dives requiring decompression
- **Safety officers** reviewing dive plans and procedures
- **Training personnel** teaching decompression procedures
- **Operational planners** developing dive procedures and standards

## Critical Safety Requirements

Before using these tables operationally:

1. **Verify against original publication** — Cross-reference all values with the official NAVSEA publication (SS521-AG-PRO-010)
2. **Proper training required** — Users must be trained in decompression table procedures
3. **Medical clearance** — Divers must be medically cleared for diving operations
4. **Equipment verification** — All diving equipment must be verified and functional
5. **Supervisor oversight** — All decompression dives require qualified supervisor oversight

**What can go wrong:** Incorrect table use, transcription errors, missing updates, improper application. Each failure mode can result in decompression sickness, injury, or death.

**Publication Authority:** Published by Direction of Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command

## Operational Use

Before operational use:

1. **Obtain official publication** — Secure the official NAVSEA publication
2. **Verify all values** — Cross-check all table values against the official publication
3. **Training verification** — Ensure all personnel are properly trained
4. **Medical clearance** — Verify all divers are medically cleared
5. **Equipment check** — Verify all equipment is functional and calibrated
6. **Supervisor approval** — Obtain qualified supervisor approval for all dives

**Responsibility:** The dive supervisor is responsible for ensuring correct table use. Incorrect application can result in serious injury or death.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the U.S. Navy dive tables used for?

The USN dive tables are the primary reference for decompression planning in air and mixed-gas diving. They determine the maximum no-decompression bottom time at any depth, the repetitive group accumulated after surfacing, the required surface interval before a second dive, the residual nitrogen time to add to a repetitive dive, and the full decompression schedule (stops, times, gas) when decompression is required.

### What edition is current?

**Revision 7 (SS521-AG-PRO-010, 01 December 2016)** is the current edition. Always confirm you are using Revision 7 and obtain the official NAVSEA publication before operational use.

### Where is the interactive lookup tool?

The [USN Air Dive Tables](/commercial-diving/usn-air-dive-tables/) page includes a JavaScript-powered NDL lookup tool for Tables 9-7 and 9-8. Enter depth and bottom time for instant NDL and repetitive group lookup, and enter your surface interval for repetitive dive RNT calculations.
