# Emergency Response Frameworks

This page covers operational frameworks for emergency response in commercial diving operations. It documents response structures, responsibility boundaries, and decision-making frameworks—not step-by-step rescue procedures.

## Why This Exists

Emergency response requires clear frameworks: who responds, how decisions are made, and what resources are available. This page provides the operational structure for emergency response, not medical or rescue instruction.

## Who This Is For

- Dive supervisors planning emergency response
- Safety officers developing emergency procedures
- Operations managers ensuring emergency readiness
- Auditors reviewing emergency procedures

## Emergency Response Structure

### Response Roles

Emergency response requires defined roles:

- **Incident commander** — Overall responsibility for emergency response
- **Dive supervisor** — Diving-specific response coordination
- **Standby diver** — Immediate response capability
- **Medical support** — Medical response (if available)
- **Surface support** — Surface equipment and personnel

**Responsibility boundaries:** Each role must have clear responsibilities. Ambiguity in roles leads to delayed or incorrect response.

### Decision-Making Authority

Emergency response requires clear decision-making:

- **Who decides** — Who has authority to make emergency decisions?
- **Decision criteria** — What criteria guide emergency decisions?
- **Escalation** — When are decisions escalated?
- **Documentation** — How are emergency decisions documented?

**Operational reality:** Emergency decisions must be made quickly. Decision-making authority must be clear and documented.

### Resource Availability

Emergency response requires resources:

- **Personnel** — Trained personnel available for response
- **Equipment** — Emergency equipment ready and functional
- **Communication** — Communication systems for coordination
- **Medical** — Medical support available (if applicable)

**What can go wrong:** Resources not available, resources not ready, resources not sufficient. Emergency readiness must be verified.

## Emergency Categories

### Diver Emergency

Emergency involving the diver:

- **Loss of communication** — Diver cannot communicate
- **Equipment failure** — Critical equipment failure
- **Medical emergency** — Medical issue requiring response
- **Entanglement** — Diver entangled and unable to free self

**Response framework:** Standby diver deployment, surface support, medical response (if applicable). Specific procedures depend on circumstances.

### Surface Emergency

Emergency involving surface systems:

- **Gas supply failure** — Loss of primary gas supply
- **Communication failure** — Loss of communication systems
- **Equipment failure** — Critical surface equipment failure
- **Personnel emergency** — Medical emergency on surface

**Response framework:** Backup systems activation, alternative procedures, medical response (if applicable).

### Environmental Emergency

Emergency due to environmental conditions:

- **Rapid weather change** — Weather conditions deteriorate
- **Current increase** — Current becomes too strong
- **Visibility loss** — Visibility becomes insufficient
- **Marine life** — Dangerous marine life encounter

**Response framework:** Mission abort, diver recovery, surface operations secured.

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Response

Immediate actions upon emergency recognition:

1. **Recognize emergency** — Identify that emergency exists
2. **Alert team** — Alert response team
3. **Initiate response** — Begin response procedures
4. **Monitor situation** — Continuously monitor situation

**What can go wrong:** Emergency not recognized, alert not sent, response delayed, situation not monitored. Immediate response must be practiced and automatic.

### Response Execution

Execution of response procedures:

- **Follow procedures** — Execute documented procedures
- **Adapt as needed** — Adapt procedures to circumstances
- **Coordinate resources** — Coordinate available resources
- **Document actions** — Document all response actions

**Operational reality:** Procedures provide framework, but response must adapt to circumstances. Documentation is essential for post-incident review.

### Post-Emergency

Actions after emergency resolved:

- **Secure situation** — Ensure situation is secure
- **Assess condition** — Assess condition of personnel and equipment
- **Debrief** — Conduct debrief of response
- **Document incident** — Document incident and response

**Responsibility:** Supervisor ensures proper post-emergency procedures. Documentation is essential for learning and improvement.

## Communication During Emergency

### Emergency Communication

Communication during emergency:

- **Alert communication** — How emergency is communicated
- **Status updates** — Regular status updates during response
- **Resource coordination** — Communication for resource coordination
- **External communication** — Communication with external resources (if needed)

**What can go wrong:** Communication breakdown, unclear communication, delayed communication. Emergency communication must be practiced and reliable.

### Backup Communication

Backup communication methods:

- **Alternative systems** — Alternative communication systems
- **Visual signals** — Visual signals when communication lost
- **Surface-to-surface** — Surface-to-surface coordination
- **External resources** — Communication with external resources

**Operational reality:** Backup communication is essential. Single point of failure is unacceptable.

## Medical Considerations

### Medical Support

Medical support availability:

- **On-site medical** — Medical personnel on-site (if available)
- **Remote medical** — Remote medical consultation (if available)
- **Medical equipment** — Medical equipment available
- **Evacuation** — Medical evacuation capability (if available)

**Operational reality:** Medical support varies by operation. Operations must plan for available medical support.

### Medical Decision-Making

Medical decision-making during emergency:

- **Who decides** — Who has medical decision-making authority?
- **Decision criteria** — What criteria guide medical decisions?
- **Documentation** — How are medical decisions documented?

**Legal sensitivity:** Medical decisions have legal implications. Decision-making authority must be clear and documented.

## Training & Readiness

### Emergency Training

Emergency response training:

- **Regular training** — Regular emergency response training
- **Scenario training** — Training in realistic scenarios
- **Role training** — Training for specific roles
- **Refresher training** — Regular refresher training

**What can go wrong:** Training not conducted, training not realistic, training not sufficient. Emergency training must be regular and realistic.

### Readiness Verification

Verification of emergency readiness:

- **Equipment checks** — Regular equipment readiness checks
- **Personnel verification** — Verification of trained personnel availability
- **Procedure review** — Regular review of emergency procedures
- **Drill execution** — Regular emergency drills

**Operational reality:** Readiness must be verified, not assumed. Regular verification is essential.

## Documentation Requirements

Emergency response documentation must include:

- **Emergency description** — What emergency occurred
- **Response actions** — What actions were taken
- **Decision-making** — How decisions were made
- **Outcome** — What was the outcome
- **Lessons learned** — What was learned

**Audit requirement:** Emergency response documentation must be suitable for regulatory review and incident investigation.
