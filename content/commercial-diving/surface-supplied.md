# Surface-Supplied Diving Systems

Surface-supplied diving is the standard operational mode for most commercial diving work. This page covers the equipment, procedures, and operational considerations that matter in practice.

## Why This Exists

Surface-supplied diving provides continuous gas supply, real-time communication, and direct surface supervision. Unlike scuba, the diver remains connected to the surface, enabling longer bottom times, better safety oversight, and support for complex work tasks.

## Who This Is For

- Commercial divers working surface-supplied
- Dive supervisors planning and overseeing operations
- Tenders and support personnel
- Safety officers reviewing procedures
- Auditors assessing operational compliance

## System Components

### Gas Supply System

The surface gas supply provides breathing gas to the diver through an umbilical. In practice, this means:

- **Primary gas supply** — Typically air or nitrox for shallow work, helium-oxygen (heliox) or trimix for deeper operations
- **Backup gas supply** — Independent secondary system with sufficient capacity for emergency ascent
- **Gas quality monitoring** — Continuous analysis of oxygen content, contaminants, and pressure
- **Emergency gas** — Bailout cylinder carried by diver for emergency ascent

**What can go wrong:** Gas supply failure, contamination, incorrect gas mix, umbilical damage. Each failure mode requires specific response procedures documented in dive plans.

### Diving Umbilical

The umbilical carries gas, communication, and sometimes power to the diver. Operational considerations:

- **Gas hose** — Primary breathing gas supply, typically 3/8" to 1/2" ID
- **Communication cable** — Hard-wired or fiber-optic voice communication
- **Hot water hose** — For thermal protection in cold water (if applicable)
- **Strength member** — Steel wire or Kevlar strength member for load handling
- **Umbilical management** — Tending, deployment, and recovery procedures

**What can go wrong:** Umbilical entanglement, damage from sharp edges, communication loss, gas supply interruption. Umbilical management is a critical operational skill.

### Diving Helmet or Full-Face Mask

The diver's interface with the surface-supplied system:

- **Helmet systems** — Hard hat with integrated communication, gas supply, and exhaust
- **Full-face mask systems** — Lighter weight alternative with similar functionality
- **Communication** — Hard-wired voice communication with surface
- **Gas flow** — Demand valve or free-flow system depending on design

**What can go wrong:** Communication failure, mask flooding, gas flow interruption, vision obstruction. Divers must be trained in emergency procedures for each failure mode.

### Diver Monitoring

Surface personnel monitor diver status through:

- **Voice communication** — Continuous or periodic check-ins
- **Depth monitoring** — Depth gauge or transducer on surface
- **Gas consumption** — Flow meters and pressure monitoring
- **Visual observation** — When visibility permits, direct observation from surface

**What can go wrong:** Communication loss, depth monitoring failure, missed check-ins. Supervisors must have clear procedures for handling loss of communication.

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Dive Checks

Before each dive, verify:

1. **Gas supply** — Primary and backup systems operational, correct gas mix, sufficient volume
2. **Umbilical** — No damage, proper routing, adequate length for planned work
3. **Communication** — Two-way communication functional, backup communication available
4. **Diver equipment** — Helmet/mask, bailout, tools, work equipment checked
5. **Surface support** — Tender, supervisor, standby diver, emergency equipment ready

**Responsibility:** Dive supervisor verifies surface systems; diver verifies personal equipment. Both must confirm before dive commences.

### During Dive Operations

Standard operational practices:

- **Check-in procedures** — Regular voice check-ins at specified intervals
- **Depth/time tracking** — Continuous monitoring of depth and bottom time
- **Gas management** — Monitoring consumption and remaining supply
- **Work task execution** — Following planned work procedures
- **Umbilical management** — Maintaining proper umbilical routing and avoiding entanglement

**What can go wrong:** Task fixation leading to missed check-ins, umbilical entanglement, gas consumption exceeding plan, communication degradation. Supervisors must maintain situational awareness and intervene when necessary.

### Post-Dive Procedures

After dive completion:

- **Equipment recovery** — Safe recovery of diver and umbilical
- **Equipment inspection** — Post-dive inspection for damage or wear
- **Debrief** — Discussion of dive execution, issues encountered, lessons learned
- **Documentation** — Recording dive details in dive log

**Responsibility:** Supervisor ensures proper recovery and documentation; diver reports any issues or anomalies.

## Failure Modes & Response

### Communication Loss

**What happens:** Diver cannot communicate with surface, or surface cannot hear diver.

**Response framework:**
- Surface attempts to re-establish communication
- If no response, initiate emergency procedures
- Standby diver may be deployed to locate and assist
- Emergency ascent procedures activated if necessary

**Responsibility:** Supervisor initiates response; standby diver executes if deployed.

### Gas Supply Failure

**What happens:** Primary gas supply interrupted or contaminated.

**Response framework:**
- Diver switches to bailout cylinder
- Surface attempts to restore primary supply
- If restoration fails, initiate emergency ascent
- Standby diver may be deployed to assist

**Responsibility:** Diver executes immediate bailout; surface supports recovery.

### Umbilical Entanglement

**What happens:** Umbilical becomes entangled in structure or equipment.

**Response framework:**
- Diver attempts to clear entanglement
- Surface provides guidance and support
- If unable to clear, standby diver may be deployed
- Emergency procedures activated if diver cannot be freed

**Responsibility:** Diver attempts self-rescue first; surface coordinates response.

## Operational Limits

Surface-supplied diving has practical limits:

- **Depth limits** — Typically 50-60m on air, deeper with mixed gas (subject to gas mix and decompression requirements)
- **Bottom time** — Limited by decompression requirements and gas supply
- **Work complexity** — Constrained by umbilical management and communication requirements
- **Environmental conditions** — Current, visibility, and sea state affect operational feasibility

**What can go wrong:** Operations planned beyond practical limits, environmental conditions worse than anticipated, equipment limitations not recognized. Dive planning must account for these limits.

## Data & Records

Surface-supplied diving operations generate records:

- **Dive logs** — Depth, time, gas consumption, work performed
- **Communication records** — Voice logs (if recorded)
- **Equipment records** — Maintenance, inspection, and failure records
- **Incident reports** — Documentation of anomalies, near-misses, or incidents

**Audit-worthiness:** Records must be traceable, timestamped, and suitable for regulatory review. See [Dive Logs & Operational Records](/commercial-diving/dive-logs/) for detailed requirements.
