# Melon Wiki

**An authoritative knowledge base for commercial diving, subsea robotics, and autonomous maritime operations.**

Melon Wiki serves as a public technical reference, trust anchor for regulators and operators, and living standard for safe, auditable, and modern subsea operations.

## Who This Is For

- **Commercial divers** and dive supervisors planning and executing operations
- **ROV pilots** and robotics engineers developing autonomous systems
- **Marine engineers** designing subsea infrastructure
- **Safety officers** and risk managers ensuring operational compliance
- **Auditors** and regulators reviewing operational procedures
- **Insurance underwriters** assessing operational risk
- **Robotics developers** building autonomous maritime systems

## Core Principles

### Operationally Real
This documentation assumes readers work offshore. We prefer "how this actually works" over theory, and "what can go wrong" over optimistic scenarios.

### Audit-Worthy
Every page is suitable for incident review, regulatory audits, insurance underwriting, and client due diligence. We explicitly document assumptions, failure modes, data provenance, and responsibility boundaries.

### Modular & Extensible
Each page stands alone while maintaining clear cross-links. The structure is designed to grow into training materials, certification references, and machine-readable standards.

## Major Sections

### [Commercial Diving Operations](/commercial-diving/)
Surface-supplied diving, saturation diving overview, dive planning, decompression theory, emergency procedures, human factors, and operational records.

### [Subsea Robotics & Autonomous Systems](/subsea-robotics/)
ROV vs AUV platforms, vehicle classes, sensor payloads, power systems, failure modes, and human-in-the-loop control.

### [Ocean Data & Trust](/ocean-data/)
Data provenance, sensor calibration traceability, timestamp integrity, geospatial confidence, and audit logs.

### [Safety, Risk & Compliance](/safety-compliance/)
Operational risk models, hazard identification, ALARP principles, responsibility boundaries, and regulatory landscape.

### [Swarm & Networked Systems](/swarm-systems/)
Multi-vehicle coordination, acoustic vs RF communications, latency tradeoffs, and graceful degradation.

### [Simulation, Training & Validation](/simulation-training/)
Physics realism, confidence calibration, digital twins, and pre-mission rehearsal.

### [Open Standards & Future Directions](/open-standards/)
Gaps in current standards, autonomy challenges, auditability requirements, and open problems.

### [Glossary](/glossary/)
Consistent terminology definitions across all sections.

## What This Is Not

- **Medical advice** — We do not provide medical instruction or step-by-step rescue procedures
- **Proprietary procedures** — All content is open-source and publicly auditable
- **Marketing material** — This is technical documentation, not product promotion

## Contributing

Melon Wiki is open-source. Contributions that improve accuracy, clarity, and operational relevance are welcome.
