# Ocean Data & Trust

This section covers data integrity, provenance, and auditability for ocean operations. As operations become more autonomous and data-driven, trust in data becomes essential for regulatory compliance, incident investigation, and operational decision-making.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Data provenance & chain-of-custody** — Where data came from and who handled it
- **Sensor calibration traceability** — How sensors were calibrated and when
- **Timestamp integrity** — Ensuring timestamps are accurate and tamper-resistant
- **Geospatial confidence & uncertainty** — Understanding position accuracy and uncertainty
- **Raw vs derived data** — Distinguishing measured data from calculated data
- **Audit logs & immutability** — Creating tamper-resistant records suitable for audit

## Key Principles

1. **Provenance matters** — Data must be traceable to its source
2. **Calibration is critical** — Sensor data is only as good as calibration
3. **Timestamps must be trusted** — Time synchronization and integrity are essential
4. **Uncertainty must be quantified** — All measurements have uncertainty
5. **Records must be immutable** — Audit logs must be tamper-resistant
