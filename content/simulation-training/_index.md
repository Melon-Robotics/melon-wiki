# Simulation, Training & Validation

This section covers simulation frameworks, training applications, and validation methods for subsea operations. Simulation enables safe testing, training, and validation before real-world deployment.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Why simulation matters** — The role of simulation in offshore operations
- **Physics realism vs control realism** — Tradeoffs in simulation fidelity
- **Confidence calibration** — Understanding when simulation results are trustworthy
- **Digital twins** — Practical definition and application
- **Pre-mission rehearsal** — Using simulation for mission planning and validation

## Key Principles

1. **Simulation is not reality** — Simulation results must be validated against reality
2. **Fidelity tradeoffs** — Higher fidelity is not always better; match fidelity to purpose
3. **Confidence matters** — Understanding simulation confidence is essential
4. **Validation is required** — Simulation must be validated before relying on results
