# Glossary

This glossary provides consistent definitions for terms used throughout Melon Wiki. Terms are defined in operational context, not academic abstraction.

## A

**ALARP** — As Low As Reasonably Practicable. A risk management principle requiring that risks be reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable given technical, economic, and operational constraints.

**AUV** — Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. An untethered underwater robot that operates without direct human control.

## B

**Bailout** — Emergency breathing gas supply carried by a diver for emergency ascent.

**Bottom time** — The time a diver spends at maximum depth during a dive, used for decompression calculations.

## C

**Chain-of-custody** — The documented record of who had custody of data or equipment at each point in time, required for legal and regulatory purposes.

**Commercial diving** — Professional diving operations performed for commercial purposes, as opposed to recreational or military diving.

## D

**Decompression** — The process of gradually reducing pressure to allow dissolved gases (primarily nitrogen) to safely leave body tissues, preventing decompression sickness.

**Digital twin** — A digital representation of a physical system that is kept synchronized with the physical system and used for simulation, monitoring, and analysis.

## E

**Emergency procedures** — Pre-defined procedures for responding to emergencies, including equipment failures, medical emergencies, and loss of communication.

## F

**Failure mode** — A specific way in which a system can fail, including the conditions that lead to failure and the consequences of failure.

**Failsafe** — A system design that causes the system to enter a safe state when a failure occurs.

## G

**Geospatial confidence** — The level of confidence in a position measurement, typically expressed as an uncertainty ellipse or circle.

## H

**HAZID** — Hazard Identification. A structured process for identifying hazards in operations.

**HAZOP** — Hazard and Operability Study. A structured process for identifying hazards and operability problems.

**Heliox** — A breathing gas mixture of helium and oxygen, used for deep diving to reduce nitrogen narcosis and decompression requirements.

## I

**IMCA** — International Marine Contractors Association. An industry association that publishes guidelines for marine operations.

**INS** — Inertial Navigation System. A navigation system that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to track position and orientation.

## L

**Latency** — The time delay between sending a signal and receiving a response, critical for real-time control systems.

**Loss-of-comms** — The condition when communication between vehicle and surface is lost, requiring autonomous operation.

## M

**Manipulator** — A robotic arm on an ROV used for work tasks such as tool use, object manipulation, and installation.

## N

**Nitrox** — A breathing gas mixture with higher oxygen content than air, used to reduce nitrogen exposure and extend bottom time.

## O

**Operational records** — Documentation of operational activities, including dive logs, equipment records, and incident reports, required for regulatory compliance and audit.

## P

**Provenance** — The record of where data came from, how it was created, and who handled it, required for data integrity and auditability.

## R

**ROV** — Remotely Operated Vehicle. A tethered underwater robot controlled from the surface.

## S

**Saturation diving** — A diving technique where divers live in a pressurized environment (saturation system) and are transported to work depth in a diving bell, allowing extended work periods without decompression between dives.

**Sensor calibration** — The process of adjusting sensor readings to match known reference values, with traceability to calibration standards.

**Surface-supplied diving** — Diving where breathing gas is supplied from the surface through an umbilical, as opposed to self-contained (scuba) diving.

## T

**Timestamp integrity** — The assurance that timestamps are accurate, synchronized, and tamper-resistant, required for auditability and legal purposes.

**Tether** — The cable connecting an ROV to the surface, carrying power, communication, and sometimes strength member for recovery.

**Trimix** — A breathing gas mixture of helium, nitrogen, and oxygen, used for very deep diving.

## U

**Umbilical** — The cable connecting a diver or ROV to the surface, carrying breathing gas, communication, and other services.

**Uncertainty** — The quantitative expression of doubt about a measurement, typically expressed as a confidence interval or standard deviation.

## V

**Vehicle class** — A categorization of underwater vehicles by size, capability, and intended use (e.g., observation-class, work-class, survey-class).
