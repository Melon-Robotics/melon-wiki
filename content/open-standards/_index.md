# Open Standards & Future Directions

This section identifies gaps in current industry standards, explores where autonomy challenges legacy assumptions, and discusses open problems in subsea operations. This section is forward-looking and acknowledges uncertainty.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Gaps in current standards** — Where existing standards fall short
- **Autonomy challenges** — How autonomy challenges legacy assumptions
- **Auditability requirements** — Why auditability will matter more than raw autonomy
- **Open problems** — Unsolved problems in subsea operations

## Key Principles

1. **Standards evolve** — Standards must evolve as technology and operations evolve
2. **Autonomy changes assumptions** — Autonomy challenges many legacy assumptions
3. **Auditability is essential** — As systems become more autonomous, auditability becomes more important
4. **Problems remain open** — Many problems in subsea operations remain unsolved
