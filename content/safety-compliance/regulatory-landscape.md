# Regulatory Landscape Overview

Commercial diving and subsea operations are governed by a complex patchwork of national regulations, international conventions, and industry standards. No single framework covers all aspects of all operations. Operators must identify which regulations apply, in which jurisdictions, and how potentially conflicting requirements are resolved.

## Why This Exists

Regulatory compliance is not optional, but the landscape is genuinely complex. Jurisdiction, activity type, depth, location (offshore vs. inland), and vehicle type all affect which rules apply. This page provides an orientation to the major frameworks without substituting for qualified legal and regulatory advice.

## Who This Is For

- Operations managers planning activities in new jurisdictions
- Safety officers building compliance frameworks
- Legal and compliance teams assessing regulatory exposure
- Project managers identifying regulatory risks

## Regulatory Principles

### Jurisdiction

Who regulates an activity depends on where it happens and who is doing it:

- **Flag state** — The country whose flag a vessel flies has jurisdiction over that vessel
- **Coastal state** — The country whose territorial waters or EEZ an operation is in has jurisdiction over the activity
- **Employer state** — The country in which a company is registered has jurisdiction over its employees
- **Multiple overlapping jurisdictions** — Common in international offshore operations

When jurisdictions overlap, the most stringent requirement typically applies in practice.

### Flag State vs. Port State Control

Flag states register and inspect vessels; port state control authorities inspect foreign-flagged vessels when they visit ports. Port state control can detain non-compliant vessels regardless of flag state inspection status.

## Major Regulatory Bodies

### United Kingdom

- **HSE (Health and Safety Executive)** — Regulates diving operations under the Diving at Work Regulations 1997
- **OPRED (Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning)** — Offshore environmental regulations
- **MCA (Maritime and Coastguard Agency)** — Vessel safety

**Key regulation:** Diving at Work Regulations 1997 require a written diving project plan, competent diving contractor, and compliance with approved codes of practice (ACOPs).

### United States

- **OSHA** — Occupational Safety and Health Administration; regulates commercial diving under 29 CFR 1910 Subpart T (general industry) and 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Y (construction)
- **USCG (US Coast Guard)** — Vessel safety, diving from vessels
- **BSEE (Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement)** — Offshore oil and gas operations

**Key standard:** OSHA 29 CFR 1910.410-440 sets detailed requirements for commercial diving including equipment, procedures, records, and emergency support.

### International Maritime Organisation (IMO)

IMO develops international conventions adopted by member states:

- **SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea)** — Vessel safety
- **MARPOL** — Marine pollution prevention
- **ISM Code (International Safety Management)** — Safety management systems for vessels

IMO conventions apply to vessels of signatory states operating internationally.

## Key Industry Standards

### IMCA (International Marine Contractors Association)

IMCA produces guidance documents widely adopted as industry best practice:

- **IMCA D 014** — Guidance for diving supervisors
- **IMCA D 022** — Guidance on competence assessment
- **IMCA D 018** — Air diving operations
- **IMCA ROV** series — ROV operations guidance

IMCA standards are not legally binding but are frequently referenced by regulators as indicators of industry best practice.

### DNV (Det Norske Veritas)

DNV produces classification rules for offshore vessels, diving systems, and subsea equipment. Classification by DNV (or other class societies) provides assurance of system integrity and is often required for insurance and contracting.

### ISO Standards

Relevant ISO standards include:

- **ISO 24801** — Recreational scuba diver training (less relevant for commercial)
- **ISO 9001** — Quality management systems
- **ISO 45001** — Occupational health and safety management systems

### NFPA and ASTM

US-focused standards bodies with relevance to hyperbaric facilities and equipment.

## Operational Frameworks

### Safety Case Regime

Some jurisdictions (UK, Australia, Norway) require operators to produce a Safety Case — a structured document demonstrating that major accident risks have been identified and reduced to ALARP. The Safety Case must be accepted by the regulator before operations can commence.

### Prescriptive Regulation

Other jurisdictions (some OSHA regimes) specify exactly what operators must do (equipment specifications, procedure requirements) rather than requiring the operator to demonstrate outcomes. Prescriptive rules are easier to audit but may be less flexible for novel operations.

## Regulatory Gaps for Novel Operations

Existing regulations were not designed for autonomous vehicles, swarm systems, or AI-assisted operations. See [Gaps in Current Standards](/open-standards/gaps/) and [Autonomy Challenges & Legacy Assumptions](/open-standards/autonomy-challenges/) for discussion of where current frameworks fail.
