# Safety, Risk & Compliance

This section covers operational risk management, hazard identification, safety frameworks, and regulatory compliance for commercial diving and subsea operations. Content focuses on practical frameworks rather than abstract theory.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- **Operational risk models** — How to assess and manage operational risk
- **Hazard identification** — HAZID/HAZOP concepts and practical application
- **ALARP principles** — As Low As Reasonably Practicable assessment and implementation
- **Contractor vs operator responsibilities** — Responsibility boundaries and accountability
- **Regulatory landscape** — DNV, IMCA, ADCI, ISO standards (descriptive overview)

## Key Principles

1. **Risk is real** — Risk assessment must reflect actual operational conditions
2. **ALARP is a process** — ALARP is not a number, it's a process of continuous improvement
3. **Responsibility matters** — Clear responsibility boundaries prevent gaps and overlaps
4. **Compliance is baseline** — Regulatory compliance is minimum, not target
5. **Documentation is essential** — Risk decisions must be documented and defensible
